// What Red Faction: Guerrilla's player gear (its weapons, its upgrades, and later its backpacks) needs
// from Armageddon's engine that it doesn't do itself. Its upgrades, bought in an F7 window, are in
// upgrades.cpp. The weapons are made from the player's own copy
// of Guerrilla by GuerrillaBuilder.exe (never shipped): see RfaFormats\Guerrilla\GuerrillaWeapons.cs;
// the guerrilla_world mod hands the game their tables at start-up.
//
// Room for more inventory items: every weapon a player can carry has an inventory item of its own
// (items_inventory.xtbl; a weapon is given by its inventory item, and the game finds the weapon whose
// Inventory_Item it is). The game keeps them in one table of 85 (MAX_INV_ITEM_TYPES; 0x30 bytes an
// item, from 0x19F8578, how many at 0x19F8570), filled while it starts (the loader 0x7A7710: "Too many
// inventory item types. Get a programmer to increase MAX_INV_ITEM_TYPES." at 85). Armageddon's own are
// 75 and its Path to War add-on's 4 more while one of its levels is loaded; Guerrilla's campaign weapons
// are about 25. The table is a global the game's code reaches by its address, written into five
// instructions: the loader (its next entry, `add edx,19F8578h` at 0x7A782A), the lookup by name
// (0x7A7DA0: `mov dword ptr [ebp-8],19F8578h` at 0x7A7DB7), the lookup by name hash (0x7A82F0: the
// hash at +4, `add ecx,19F857Ch` at 0x7A8317, and the entry, `add eax,19F8578h` at 0x7A832D), and the
// start-up constructor (0xF2C330: `push 19F8578h` at 0xF2C33C, which builds each entry with 0x963420
// through the vector constructor 0x422890). Its size is in two: the loader's check (`cmp dword ptr
// [19F8570h],55h` at 0x7A77F0) and the constructor's `push 55h` at 0xF2C338. Both sizes are one-byte
// values in the instructions (signed: at most 127), so the table can grow to 127 there. Nothing else
// reaches the table (a scan of every 4-byte value in the exe found these five; the other matches are
// parts of call and jump instructions), and each item's number in it is a byte (+0x24).
//
// The mod moves the table to one of 127 of its own, all or nothing: each of those values is checked
// against the game's first. The game's start-up constructor runs after the mods load and builds the
// new table's entries; the mod builds them too in case it has already run.
//
// Room for the animations' triggers. While the game reads its animation sets (0x979C20, at start-up) it
// copies each anim_files.xtbl entry's lists into five static pools, a record each: effects (0x97B940,
// 16 bytes, 64 at 0x261C4D0), voice lines (0x97B820, 8, 320 at 0x261C8D0), sounds (0x97B640, 16, 960 at
// 0x261D2D0), props (0x97ADA0, 36, 256 at 0x2620ED0) and hand IKs (0x97B400, 8, 1,300 at 0x26232D0),
// each with a count of records in use (0x2632190, 0x263218C, 0x2632188, 0x2632184, 0x2632180); each
// animation keeps a pointer to its first record. No room is checked: Armageddon's own fill them nearly
// full, and with Guerrilla's people, vehicles and player animations four ran over, spoiling what
// follows (a cutscene's prop trigger with a sound's numbers in it stopped the campaign). Each pool's
// address is in exactly two instructions, both in its reader (everything after reads the animations'
// own pointers), so the mod moves the five to bigger tables of its own (16 times or more), all or
// nothing, each place checked against the game's value first, and logs how full each is.
//
// Guerrilla's player animations for its guns (GuerrillaBuilder.exe builds them with the guns: see
// RfaFormats\Guerrilla\GuerrillaPlayerAnimations.cs): a set of their own, rfg_player, built on Darius's
// (vs_player) with the variant "confident", which nothing of Armageddon's uses. A character's set is
// chosen when it is made; the game's variant functions (Guerrilla's, still in Armageddon: a drunk or
// wounded civilian plays its variant set) switch a character to the set built on its own that has a
// variant, and back. The mod needs three things for it:
//   - the switch: when the player takes up a gun the game sets his animation group, the gun's
//     (character_instance::set_animation_group, 0x969110, thiscall: the group, a blend, ...; from
//     human::equip, 0x84DD70, with the gun just taken up at human+0x1394 -> +8 -> +0x20, its weapon
//     entry, whose +0 is its name). The mod runs it with the player's set switched first
//     (vanim_set_base_animation_set_variant, 0x98C310, cdecl: the character's animation state, the
//     character instance's +4; the variant, -1 for none) to rfg_player for one of the guns
//     mods\guerrilla_gear\player_weapons.txt names, and back to Darius's own for any other;
//   - room in the (set, animation) map: every set's states and actions are one place each in three
//     tables and a bit set the game makes while it reads the sets (0x97D6B0, from the sets' loading
//     0x979C20), from the Permanent Mempool (0x26AEE78), 6,344 places (the value at 0x1107C58, read only
//     there). The sets' reader doesn't check it: more states and actions than that spoil the memory
//     after the tables. Armageddon's own and Guerrilla's vehicles' and people's sets come close to it,
//     and rfg_player adds about 650, so the mod raises the value to 16,384 just before the sets are
//     read (a value in the game's data, not its code), if the mempool has room for it, and says how
//     many are in use after;
//   - the animations: written into mods\guerrilla_gear\animations\ (rfgpl_<Guerrilla's name>.anim_pc,
//     Armageddon's packing), loaded once and kept, as Armageddon keeps its player's: right after the
//     sets' loading (the animation library was emptied just before it, 0xD89F00 from 0x967B90, and
//     nothing empties it after), each one overlaid on its place in the library by name (as the
//     guerrilla_people mod loads its people's).
//
// Guerrilla's dropped guns. Guerrilla's NPCs carry the player's own guns (its EDF the m16 and the
// enforcer), and a gun one drops (dying, ragdolling, the AI's drop action) can be picked up as any
// other. What it carries is Guerrilla's own rule (weapon::adjust_dropped_ammo, for a gun anyone but the
// player drops): the rounds it and its owner's reserve held × its Dropped_ammo_scale (0.4 for every EDF
// gun) × the difficulty's "player ammo pickup" (Easy 2.0, Medium 1.0, Hard 0.9, Insane 0.8); a
// magazine of 0.5 to 1.5 × the scale of a full one, at least 1 round; the rest in reserve. Picking it
// up: walking over it gives its rounds as ammo if the player has that gun, else the gun itself with
// them into a free slot; with none free, the action button swaps it for the gun in hand. Armageddon
// keeps the rules (its pickup, 0x7CAE20, the items' give_item touch; its swap, 0x8BEB00; its drop,
// 0x8A2DB0, which calls the same step, 0x731A10, for an NPC's gun only) but not the numbers: its step
// keeps a full magazine and moves the scale × the owner's reserve into the gun, its pickup gives the
// firing mode's Rounds_On_Pickup instead of the gun's rounds, and its "player ammo pickup" is 1.0 at
// every difficulty. So, for Guerrilla's guns (player_weapons.txt), the mod runs Guerrilla's step in
// place of Armageddon's (0x731A10 wrapped: thiscall, the weapon) and remembers the rounds; the game's
// pickup (0x7CAE20 wrapped: cdecl, the human, the item, two flags) gives a gun he has its firing mode's
// Rounds_On_Pickup (mode+0x144, through 0x8A39C0: as much as his reserve holds, shown as "+N"), so for
// that one call the mod sets it to the dropped gun's rounds: he gets Guerrilla's, and the "+N" says so.
// A gun he hasn't, into a free slot, and the swapped-in gun (0x85B3E0 wrapped: cdecl, the human, the
// item, a slot, three flags) get their magazine (the game's setter 0x7310F0, thiscall: the rounds, the
// mode) and reserve set to them, through the game's own ammo store (0x84E8F0; its reserve 0x70EF40, add
// 0x70F4F0, take 0x70F650). A gun's magazine is its mode's +0x118 (weapon+0x2E0, what firing takes
// from, 0x730FB0); +0x134 (weapon+0x2FC) is the rounds a gun lying on the ground carries besides (what
// Armageddon's own step adds to and its pickup empties, 0x731BB0). Guerrilla's difficulty values come
// from the player's Guerrilla (mods\guerrilla_gear\ammo_pickup.txt), the game's difficulty from 0x10F7E98.
//
// How much ammo he carries: Guerrilla's weapon::get_max_rounds is the weapon's Max_Rounds (the loaded
// magazine counted in), Max_Rounds_Upgrade once its weapon upgrade is bought to 2 ("... AMMO",
// upgrade_weapon_has_extra_ammo), × the worn backpack's ammo_factor (from its active abilities while on, else its
// passive ones: none of Guerrilla's packs has one in either). Armageddon's
// ammo type holds its Max_Reserve (ammo info +4; +8 in multiplayer) × the store's factor less the rounds
// loaded in his guns of that type (0x70EB80), so the weapons build writes Max_Rounds there, and the mod
// sets it to the upgraded number × the pack's factor while they apply (mods\guerrilla_gear\
// ammo_capacity.txt, from the build; the ammo types by name 0x70FDA0).
//
// The player turns to where he walks. Armageddon keeps Darius facing the camera: its heading
// step (0x84C6D0, cdecl, the human; once a frame for each one on foot) sets the player's turn
// (human+0x664) toward the camera unless he sprints (player+0x1830, 0x20), and its movement step
// (0x89D0C0) turns a character toward where it goes only if its character entry lacks "always face
// target" (entry+0x28A, 0x04; Armageddon added it, its player has it, Guerrilla's Mason didn't). Its
// sprint is the one time Darius turns all the way round. The player keeps Armageddon's movement and
// does the same while he walks or runs, Darius (vs_player) in every world and Mason (rfg_mason, the
// Guerrilla world's player): the mod wraps the heading step, and for the player playing one of those
// sets, on foot, moving (this frame's movement input, 0x11BE7C4 / 0x11BE7C0), not sprinting, not
// aiming (0x8BB2F0) and not attacking (the attack buttons, 0x4E4800, and 1.5 s after), it lifts the
// flag from his entry (the entries are one table, 0x21B7538, kept for the whole game) and lets no
// camera turn through, as the sprint does; aiming or attacking he faces the camera as before.
// Standing still, Mason doesn't turn either: Guerrilla turns its player (human_set_steering_heading_offset)
// to the camera while he is combat ready, to where he goes while he moves, and not at all while he
// stands, so its camera goes round him. Darius does the same in every world (the user: "Darius too").
// Standing, the flag is lifted too: with it the movement step sets the player's facing to his target,
// where the camera aims (0x89D58C, 0x868910), every frame. And standing he looks ahead, not round at the
// camera's aim (his spine, neck and head bent toward it): Guerrilla's player looks the camera's way only
// while combat ready (see "Standing still, he looks ahead" below).
//
// Guerrilla's attacks that hold Mason where he stands. A human carries the action that holds him
// (human+0x6F0, an action handle; -1 for none) and how (+0x704: 0 his place, 1 his heading, 2 both, as
// Guerrilla's block_movement_type), set when an attack, throw, equip or landing starts. While that action
// plays an animation flagged Zero_Input, the player's movement step (0x8BDCF0) takes no input; the game
// lets go at the animation's "release movement" trigger or its end (0x89E9E0), and moving after that
// ramps the rest of it out (0x855BE0); a hold of his heading (1) keeps the heading step (0x84C6D0) from
// turning him to the camera. That is Guerrilla's rule, function for function. Guerrilla's melee start
// (human_combat_play_combat_move) holds everyone swinging; Armageddon's twin (0x880420, cdecl: the human,
// the move, two flags) holds a human swinging on the move (the move's "Forward" variant, his heading
// held on the camera's way) but one standing only if it isn't the player (0x880952), so Mason walked
// through his standing swings. The mod wraps it and, for the player playing Mason's set, holds him on the
// melee slot (0x2007) as Guerrilla does. Throws need nothing: Armageddon's throw start (0x8A3FC0) holds
// everyone as Guerrilla's does (the throw slot; his heading for a throw, both placing or throwing on the
// move). Each kind of hold Mason is put in is written to the log once ("Held: ...").
//
// Room for more projectiles (the user, 2026-11-06: "Yes, enlarge it"). Every projectile type
// (projectiles.xtbl: Armageddon's 88, its add-on's 3, Guerrilla's thrown and launched weapons' and its
// turrets') takes a place in one pool of 100 (0x2174F90, 0xC0 bytes a type), which its start-up
// constructor (0x82FE60, run with the game's own start-up code, after the mods start) builds in a
// buffer inside the pool object; a type past it is dropped without a word. Their names go into a
// 2 KB pool ("Proj String Pool") and their stages into a 96 KB one ("Projectile Mempool"), both blocks
// the projectile loader (0x82E9F0) takes from the Permanent Mempool once. The constructor's count is a
// one-byte value (127 at most) and its buffer a fixed part of the object, so the mod runs the
// constructor itself (its same calls: the pool's base, the pool made in a memory pool laid over a
// buffer, the memory pool dropped) with a buffer of its own for 256, and changes the loader's four
// sizes (each a 4-byte value) to 8 KB for the names and 256 KB for the stages: each checked against
// the game's first, none changed if one differs, those already changed put back if one can't be.
// After the loader it logs how many places, name bytes and stage bytes are in use.
//
// Room for more melee moves (the user, 2026-11-06: "Yes, enlarge it"). Every melee move (melee.xtbl:
// Armageddon's 22, Guerrilla's under rfg_ names) takes a place in a pool of 32 (0x21AFEF0, 0xE0 bytes a
// move) its start-up constructor (0x881BC0) builds as the projectiles' is built, in a buffer inside the
// object with a one-byte count; past it the reader stops. The mod runs that constructor too, with a
// buffer of its own for 64 (its three values checked first), and logs the use after melee.xtbl is read
// (0x876900 wrapped). The moves' names go into a string pool of their own, "Melee Combat Strings"
// (0x21B1BD8), of 512 bytes: the melee set-up (0x8777E0) takes 512 bytes from the Permanent Mempool
// (`push 200h` at 0x8777F2) and makes the pool over them (`push 200h` at 0x87783C); Armageddon's 22 names
// nearly fill it, and with Guerrilla's the game stopped ("Length of string pool exceeded", string_pool.cpp,
// the user's 19:57 run). Both values are made 4 KB, checked first, all or nothing, before the set-up runs
// (it runs once, at start-up); the use is logged after the reader and shown in F7 Limits. The vehicle
// reader's names pool is the same kind and as small for Guerrilla's 153 vehicles (the user, 2026-11-06:
// "Yes, raise both"): "Vehicle info strings" (0x14A15F8: the vehicles' names, models, display names,
// components, lights and props, about 9.3 KB of 8 KB; `push 2000h` at 0x6271DF and 0x627227); it is made
// 32 KB the same way. (Its neighbour "Vehicle interaction info strings", whose overflow stopped the user's
// 20:02 run, is raised by the guerrilla_vehicles mod.)
//
// Room for the preloaded items (the user, 2026-11-06: "Yes, raise it"). At start-up (0xA45600) the game
// allocates a block for its "item_preload" pool (0xA44A20: _aligned_malloc from the process heap, size
// pushed at 0xA47520) and makes the pool of it (0x512B30 on 0x26AF1A0, the same size pushed at
// 0xA4754E): 17 MB. Every "General (preloaded)" item's own container goes into it, then Armageddon's
// items_containers.gpeg_pc (its items' low-detail textures, 8.8 MB); with Guerrilla's weapons' and
// pickups' containers the peg no longer fit (the user's 18:44 and 19:38 runs). The mod makes both values
// 32 MB, before the game's start-up code runs: each checked against the game's first, neither changed if
// one differs, the first put back if the second can't be written. The pool's use shows in F7 Limits.
// The Permanent Mempool (0x26AEE78, what the game keeps for good from start-up) is made the same way just
// before it, 12 MB (`push 0C00000h` at 0xA47276 and 0xA472A4); Armageddon's own and the mods' raised tables
// no longer fit (the user's 21:19 run: "Failed aligned alloc ... in Permanent mempool cpu pool"), so it is
// made 24 MB the same way. Both pools' use is logged at the player's first step.
//
// Mason's sledgehammer. Guerrilla's Mason always has his hammer: it starts in his kit (slot 3) and
// that slot can't be swapped (player_can_swap_inv_item). With Guerrilla's hammer built (the weapons
// build's rfg_sledgehammer, sledge_upgrade_1, sledge_upgrade_2), the player playing Mason's set
// (rfg_mason) who has none of them is given the plain one, into slot 3 if it's free (the game's own
// add-by-inventory-item, 0x85B260, which takes the slot; give_player_item asks it for -1, the first
// free), checked every two seconds from the heading step above. And the game's swap (0x8BEB00 wrapped:
// cdecl, the human, the item on the ground, the slot or -1 for the gun in his hands) is refused for the
// player when the gun it would drop is one of Guerrilla's hammers. With Stonebreaker or Shattermaster
// bought (upgrades.cpp), that one is the hammer he is given: one he carries that is lesser is dropped
// (the game's own drop of an inventory record, 0x8A2DB0: cdecl, the human, the record; from his hands
// or his slots) and the better given into its slot.
//
// A carried thing thrown (Guerrilla's propane tank). Guerrilla's Mason picks a tank up, throws it, and
// it is gone from his hands: its weapon is "non-inventory", and what flies is the weapon's projectile,
// which goes off where it hits. Armageddon kept Guerrilla's throw (a weapon whose shot is "Thrown": the
// player's attack 0x8BAAF0 -> 0x8A3FC0, the throw's animation; the thing is let go at the animation's
// "impact start" trigger, 0x8A1E50 -> the weapon's launch, 0x7323C0: thiscall, position, orientation,
// velocity, whether it is placed) but its launch has two ways: a weapon in the inventory throws its
// projectile and keeps the weapon; a "non-inventory" one (weapon entry +0xA, 0x10) throws no
// projectile: it is unequipped (0x85D3C0), the carried weapon itself let fly, its record taken out of
// the inventory (0x85C260) and the player's last weapon equipped (0x8BB420); it lies where it lands to
// be picked up again. For Guerrilla's the launch is wrapped, and for one of its carried weapons whose
// shot names a projectile it runs both ways: first with the entry's flag lifted for the call (the
// projectile), then as it is (the carried one out of the hands and the inventory, the last weapon
// back: the game's own way, so the hands, the inventory and the animation group change together), and
// the weapon let fly is destroyed at once, as Guerrilla deletes it (human_delete_item_from_inventory):
// the game's own destroy (0x6D5450, the world's: thiscall, the object, true; the script function
// sf_of_delete_object's way; it marks the object and takes its body away, the world deletes it later).
// Destroying the carried weapon WITHOUT the second way (the first try, 2026-11-10) left its record in
// the inventory and in his hands with no weapon behind it: he stood carrying nothing, and setting it
// down (0x8BA7C0, from the controls 0x4E1478 and again from the equip 0x85D287) read through the empty
// hand (the user's crash at 0x8BA7D7). Should the game find no last weapon to go back to, the heading
// step gives him his sledgehammer (Guerrilla's player_equip_sledgehammer) or the first weapon in his slots.

// Materials the game draws red (a diagnostic). The game's shader library (0x6F2660 gives it) keeps each
// shader under its name with a version for each kind of mesh and variant, a 4 by 4 table filled from the
// shader files' endings (0x11234D8: kind 1 still _s, 2 skinned _c, 3 terrain _t; variant bit 0 "b", bit 1
// "m": _bs, _ms, _bms, _bc, _mc, _bmc, _ts). Binding a material's shader for a draw (0xD4D7D0, thiscall:
// the shader's number, two more) asks for the version of the mesh being drawn (the renderer's 0xD4E060 and
// 0xD4E0B0; 0xD4D650 says whether there is one), and with none, or with no shader at all (-1), draws with
// rl_debug_highlight instead: flat bright red. The binding is wrapped only to write to the log, once
// each, which shader was asked for which kind when that happens ("Red: a material on gw_standard1 is
// drawn as a mesh of the kind _c, and there is no gw_standard1_c"); what the game draws is unchanged.

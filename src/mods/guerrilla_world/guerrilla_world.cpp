// What the world ported from Red Faction: Guerrilla needs that Armageddon doesn't do itself. So
// far: Guerrilla's sky and clouds, a running clock, and the light of the sky and the sun.
//
// Guerrilla's sky is a dome coloured by the time of day: nine colour curves in each time-of-day
// set (.dtodx), four bands from the horizon up on the west side (west0-west3), four on the east
// (east0-east3) and the zenith. Its shader (rfg-skybox_s, which Armageddon still ships in
// misc.vpp_pc) picks the band from how high a point of the dome is (the mean of its angle above the
// horizon and its height, 0 at the horizon to 4 straight up), blends the two bands either side,
// and blends the west colour with the east one by how far round from west to east the point is.
//
// Its clouds (rfg-skybox-clouds_s, in Guerrilla's misc.vpp_pc) are a model round the eye, an
// overhead dome and a ring along the horizon (skybox_clouds, which both games ship), each with two
// textures holding two cloud layers each: green and alpha the layers' cover, red and blue their
// light. Each layer's cover is scaled by its strength from the time of day (overhead_layer0-3 or
// horizon_layer0-3_strength) and faded in with height; the layers are laid one over another; the
// clouds are lit by blending a front and a rear light colour (clouds_front/rear_light_color, or the
// clouds_horizon_ ones) by which way they face the time of day's light, with a rim of light where
// they are thin and between the eye and the sun (cloud_backlight_strength, _power); layers 0-1 and
// 2-3 move at their own speeds (cloud_layer01_speed, cloud_layer23_speed): along the horizon they
// slide round it, overhead (rfg-skybox-clouds-2_s) they turn about the top of the sky, tiled 4 and
// 4.5 times. In front of
// them a ring of far mountains, the backdrop (rfg-skybox-matte_s, vfx_sky_backdrop_01): its picture
// mixed with a haze colour (horizon_mountain_fog_color, _density), lit by blending the mountains'
// colour on the side facing the light and on the far side (horizon_mountain_color, _back).
//
// Armageddon reads all those curves into every time-of-day set but never draws a dome for a world:
// its scene renderer's sky step (rl_scene_renderer::render_skybox, 0xD528E0) only draws the
// unlockables viewer's background. This mod wraps that step: after the game's own, in the worlds
// named by [GuerrillaWorld] Worlds= (the ported world is "rfg"), it draws Guerrilla's sky behind
// everything, as one triangle over the whole screen at the far plane, each pixel coloured the way
// Guerrilla's shader colours its dome (kSkyShader), then the clouds over it the way Guerrilla's
// cloud shader draws them (kCloudShader), from the time of day's colours this frame times
// [GuerrillaWorld] Brightness= (read again whenever rfa_mods.ini is saved). Where the world has
// drawn something nearer, the depth test keeps it. The cloud model and textures are files in
// mods\guerrilla_world\ (clouds.bin and the textures as .dds), made from the player's own copy of
// Guerrilla; without them the sky is drawn alone.
//
// The mod draws with the game's own Direct3D 11 device, which it notes when the game makes it
// (the game imports D3D11CreateDevice), and puts back everything it changes on the device context.
//
// The clock: Armageddon still has Guerrilla's game clock, and its time of day still follows it
// every frame, but the game sets the clock's speed to 0 at start-up, so the day never moves. In our
// worlds the mod runs the clock at [GuerrillaWorld] ClockSpeed= (game seconds a real second), and
// puts the game's own speed back when a world that isn't ours is played.
//
// The view distance: the game streams a world's zones (each with its far-away ground) only within a
// radius of the player, small in the campaign (its levels are walled canyons). In our worlds, whose
// zones stream in a layer of their own, the mod widens it to [GuerrillaWorld] StreamRadius= metres
// (500 by default: the 3 × 3 of our 511 m zones around the player, as Guerrilla's own 510 m; at
// most just under two zones, 5 × 5), and puts the game's own back elsewhere.
//
// The zone size: our worlds' zones are [GuerrillaWorld] ZoneSize= metres wide (511, Guerrilla's),
// so 16 × 16 of them is Guerrilla's whole map; the mod widens the game's physics world at start-up
// to hold it (for every world: the game makes it once).
//
// The light: Armageddon lights surfaces only with lamps (its levels place lamps for the sun and the
// sky); the time of day's ambient light doesn't reach them. In our worlds the mod adds light itself,
// into the light buffer the lamps light (after the game's light pass): the sky's light, the time of
// day's ambient light from above and from below blended by which way a surface faces, times
// [GuerrillaWorld] Ambient=; and the light of the sun (or by night, the moon) along its path over
// the day, tod_light_color times Sun= (both read again whenever rfa_mods.ini is saved), with its
// shine on the surfaces that have specular maps, as Armageddon's lamps give theirs. The clouds
// are lit from the same direction. Guerrilla's colour correction (color_correct_tint and
// _saturation, ColourCorrection=), which Guerrilla applies to its whole picture and Armageddon to none
// of it, is applied with Guerrilla's tone mapping to the whole scene in its last pass, as Guerrilla's
// (Armageddon's own lamps, glows and effects with it), and without it to what the mod draws itself.
//
// The fog: Armageddon's is each environment box's, by distance only, and it keeps the time of day's
// fog curves without drawing with them. Guerrilla's is height fog, thicker low down and far away,
// from its districts' curves. In our worlds the mod draws Guerrilla's over what the world has drawn,
// before the sky, from the depth the light pass reads (Fog=, thickness; the world builder turns the
// boxes' own fog off there), and over the sky, the clouds and the backdrop as Guerrilla's sky shaders
// fog them, with the clouds' ambient light as Guerrilla adds it.
//
// The tone mapping: Armageddon turns its picture into the final one with an exposure the environment
// box sets (3 in our zones), a curve that clips its highlights and a colour table. In our worlds the
// mod holds that exposure at 1 and draws Guerrilla's tone mapping over the result instead: its eye
// adapting to the picture's brightness, its exposure from the time of day's curves, its bloom (the
// glow round bright things, from the picture scaled by the eye, in three stages blurred and laid
// together, as Guerrilla's compositor makes it; Bloom=), and its curve that rolls the highlights off
// (ToneMapping=, Exposure=).
//
// The sun and moons: Armageddon draws none in our worlds. The mod draws Guerrilla's: every orbital of
// the world's global time of day (the sun, Phobos and Deimos; each its own path, texture, size, colour
// and opacity over the day) as a small bright picture behind the clouds; the sun's corona (its rays,
// glow, halo and lens flares over the picture, fading as the sun is hidden or sets); the night sky's
// stars (from Guerrilla's star catalogue) and meteors; and with the tone mapping, Guerrilla's sun
// shafts, the glow streaming from the sky round the sun past whatever stands in front of it
// (SunShafts=).
//
// And it leaves out the game's "invalid mission info hash" report for our worlds' zones, which
// carry no mission (one line a zone at every load).
//
// The precache: a world keeps the files several of its containers use once, loose, in a precache
// archive, and each streaming cell's precache group in the asset list names those it needs. Which
// precache a level mounts comes from the area of its start zone's grid place, from a table filled
// once at start-up from precache.xtbl (bio, ice, magma, natural, surface; elsewhere "world"). That
// table knows only grid places, so our worlds would get the campaign's empty world_precache: for
// them the mod answers the area as the world's own name, so a world rfg mounts rfg_precache.vpp_pc.
//
// The gameplay properties: a destructible object names an entry of gameplay_properties.xtbl (its
// flags, such as shadows, a map icon or smoke when destroyed, and its importance, team and salvage).
// Armageddon's table lacks many of Guerrilla's entries and has the rest with its own settings, so the
// world builder writes Armageddon's table with Guerrilla's settings added
// (mods\guerrilla_world\gameplay_properties.xtbl). The game reads that table once, at start-up, from
// its copy of table.vpp_pc in memory, where the loader's overrides don't reach; the mod hands it the
// builder's table there, and gives the table's names more room than the game's 24 KB, which
// Armageddon's own nearly fill. Without that file the game keeps its own table. The draw distances
// (lod_properties.xtbl: the LOD class an object names, Guerrilla's switch-off distances added) are
// handed over the same way, and so are the effects: level_objects.xtbl (what a destructible object
// shows when it breaks or is hit), effects.xtbl and vfx.xtbl (the visual effects and their files),
// and explosions.xtbl (what an object dies in), each Armageddon's with Guerrilla's entries the world
// uses added under "rfg_" names; and vehicles.xtbl and vehicle_interactions.xtbl, Armageddon's with
// Guerrilla's vehicles that GuerrillaBuilder.exe made added under their own names; and glass.xtbl
// (the colour a pane's shatter is tinted by its texture), Armageddon's with Guerrilla's entries added
// under our worlds' texture names.
//
// Broken glass: Armageddon makes no bullet marks on glass at all, so in our worlds the mod makes
// Guerrilla's (its bullet hole on both faces of a pane, and mostly a crack effect and two or three
// cracks running out from it), on the game's own decals and settings (BulletDecal); and it shatters
// panes with Guerrilla's settings, all the small shards round the hit kept and thrown and spun as
// hard (GlassUpdate).
//
// The undergrowth: Guerrilla's grass and dust rocks, which its zones' terrain files scatter over 8 m
// cells and Armageddon's undergrowth code still loads, scatters and draws. Its random scatter puts
// every piece at height 0 (it takes the height before looking it up), so the mod replaces it with the
// same scatter in Guerrilla's order, the pieces on the ground (RandomlyPlace).
//
// Buildings breaking: Armageddon still runs Guerrilla's whole support system (anchors to the ground,
// links between pieces and between buildings, stress), with some of its own numbers in it. In our
// worlds the mod gives it Guerrilla's: how strongly a piece standing on the ground holds to it
// (GuerrillaAnchors=), the materials whose strength Armageddon changed and the load a building's
// weight puts on its links (GuerrillaMaterials=); and it logs what breaks (DestructionLog=). See
// "Guerrilla's buildings" below.

// lookup and then, finding none, makes a navpoint at the nearest point of an open cell and links the

//
// The user, 2026-11-10: a hammer hit's sound is "a small snippet or sometimes the full", and sounds in general
// "still need work"; other vehicles' engines and NPCs' rifle loops end by themselves in a fight. The game doesn't
// stop a sound that plays once when its effect ends (0x4F5B10: only a loop's, or with kill_sound_when_done), and
// the hits' cues have no limit of their own, so what ends them isn't known. Two things are written to the log:
//
// Wwise's own messages. The game hands Wwise a function for its errors (AK::Monitor::SetLocalOutput at 0xB97D62,
// level 3, the function 0xB97750: the error's number, its text in 16-bit letters, its level), which copies the
// text and drops it. Wrapped, they go to the log ("Wwise: ...": the first few of each text, then its count): a
// stream that can't start for want of memory, a source or a voice starving, a file not found. (The game gives all its streams 2.25 MB in
// pieces of 26 KB, 0xB9783F / 0xB97848: 88 pieces. A piece is two seconds of Armageddon's Vorbis and 0.15-0.4 s
// of Guerrilla's sound as we keep it, uncompressed.)
//
// How long an effect's sound played. The effect object's sound (0x4F8430, thiscall, 1 = the effect starts) posts
// the event (+0x1A4) and keeps the sound's handle (+0x1A8); 0xB84D20 gives a handle's game object, 0 once the
// game knows the sound ended (Wwise's end-of-event). For the sounds of the visuals the world builder added that
// play once: "Effect sounds: <visual>'s sound (event N) ended M ms after it started; ..." (the first 200), with
// how far from the camera it started, how far its effect moved meanwhile (the game moves the sound with it) and
// what Wwise said of that sound's game object. A hammer hit's waves are 0.6-1.3 s long. (The first run, 2026-11-11
// 00:16: four hits in five lasted their wave's length; one in five ended after 60-280 ms, with nothing else
// starting then.) The ends are looked for once a frame, from the effects' frame update: 0xB84D20 finds a
// handle's game object by walking every sound object in use and its events (0xB814B0, some 4 µs a time), and
// asked on every effect's sound update (some 200 a frame) for every watched sound it took 15 ms of a frame

// ---- The sun's corona
// Guerrilla's sun has a corona: its time of day gives the Sun orbital an effect (env_sun_corona_a),
// played at each level's start and kept one metre from the camera toward the sun; its five coronas
// (the sun's rays, a wide glow, a halo and two lens flares) are pictures laid over the screen round
// the sun, fading as it is hidden or sets. Armageddon reads an orbital's effect but never plays it,
// so the mod draws them as Guerrilla's corona shader (rl_corona) does, from corona.bin (each corona's
// numbers and texture, which the world builder writes from Guerrilla's effect): at the end of the
// particle phase, into the particle layer (Guerrilla draws coronas with its particles; without the
// layer, into the scene as the game's particles are), each one's colour added (its additive key is 1).
//
// How much of each is seen, as Guerrilla measures it with two occlusion queries a frame: of a square
// facing the camera round the sun, as wide as the corona's visibility radius one metre away, the share
// of its pixels on the screen where nothing was drawn (the depth still at the far plane), eased over
// the frames (while between 5% and 99%: by 0.6 × the gap × the gap each frame; else taken at once).
// The mod samples the light pass's depth over the square (8 × 8 places) into a small texture, reading
// last frame's back on the graphics card for the easing.
//
// Each corona, as rl_corona's vertex and pixel shaders work it out (the corona one metre away):
// - shown: the visibility × its fade as the sun sets (its height ÷ 0.02, 0 to 1), less the share of the
//   square off the screen, eased (smoothstep); its opacity × shown^(opacity visibility decay), its size
//   × shown^(radius visibility decay);
// - its size and colour between their start and end values by the square root of how far it is
//   between its distances (here 1 m of 0-100: a tenth of the way);
// - a square on the screen round the sun, its size in screen units (the width × its width scale; the
//   height × the screen's width ÷ height), turned by its rotation offset and 2π(½ + ½ × its rotation
//   scale × how far the sun is to the side), and moved along that turn by its position offset;
// - its brightness 1 + intensity scale × (1 − smoothstep(how far the sun is to the side))^decay;
// - its texture's colour, its saturation applied (from its grey 0.3/0.59/0.11), times its colour and
//   Guerrilla's particle tint (1.6, as its particles are drawn with), the result premultiplied by its
//   alpha and held to 0-1.
// (Not drawn: Guerrilla's view fade, off in all five; its fog, nothing one metre away; coronas in the
// world rather than on the screen, which the sun's has none of.)

// much they cover) and lays it over the picture only in its final tone mapping (rl_hdr pass 21):
// picture = 1 − (1 − particles) · e^(−exposure · (scene · (1 − cover) + bloom)). So particles keep
// the colour they are drawn in, dim only what is behind them, and never feed the bloom or the eye.
// Armageddon draws them into the lit scene before its bloom, where Guerrilla's colours (made for
// Guerrilla's way) burn out: an EDF screen's glow added to its lit screen turns white and blooms.
//
// Armageddon draws them all in one phase (0xC35FC0, thiscall, one argument, ret 4): the half-res
// ones (0xC35DD0, laid into the scene at its end), the full-resolution ones (0xC35040), then a last
// step (0xC35CF0, none) for the heat distortion, which reads the scene. All of them draw into the
// scene (half floats) with premultiplied blending (colour one / one − source alpha, alpha the same,
// all four written), so a scene cleared to nothing ends the phase holding exactly Guerrilla's
// particle buffer. In our worlds with Guerrilla's tone mapping (Particles=1): at the phase's start
// the scene is copied aside and cleared; at the last step's start (or the phase's end) what it then
// holds is copied into our layer and the scene put back, so the distortion, the bloom and the eye see
// the scene without particles; the tone mapping lays the layer over it. Otherwise the game draws its

// by (a smoke column) is fogged evenly through.

// (+0xD4 above 0: their positions the emitter's own); +0x7C the emitter's position and +0x88 its turn

// wind, the effects' wind and expression variables, and the effect player. Each frame:
//   - how much of the sky round the camera is blocked (gameaudio_update_listener_los): one 50 m ray a
//     frame (two in Armageddon, see SkyBlocked), in turn along 26 directions, each blocked if it hits
//     the world within 20 m; the share blocked, each direction weighed (up 2, up and out 1, level 0.5,
//     down 0.1);
//   - the effects' variable wind_los: the wind's speed in m/s times the share of the sky left open
//     (so none indoors), set for every effect (the camera effect's expressions fade its haze, its dust
//     and then its grit in as wind_los grows from 0 to 45; see OpacityScales);
//   - the camera effect (weather.xtbl's first Dust_effects, env_dust_camera_a; the world builder adds
//     it as rfg_env_dust_camera_a) kept playing at the camera, turned as the effects' wind blows and
//     moved upwind by up to a quarter of its radius (Dust_max_offset) as the wind nears its top speed.

// ---- Road log (RoadLog=1, a diagnosis; off by default)

// Our roads' edges show one even colour where they should hand over to the ground beside them.
// Armageddon's ground and road vertex shaders both place the ground's layers and its blend map by
// two constants the engine sets in their per-object buffer (cb2): Terrain_uv_params (register 6)
// and Terrain_subzone_offset (23), from the world position (objTM, registers 15-17, plus
// Render_offset, 18). The road's own texture doesn't use them, so if the engine doesn't set them
// for a road, only its edges go wrong. With RoadLog=1 the mod notes the game's terrain vertex
// shaders as the game makes them (by the constants they name: a road's names Edge_fade__use_spec_map),
// keeps a copy of what the game writes into each constant buffer (Map/Unmap and UpdateSubresource),
// and at each draw with a terrain shader logs that buffer's registers when their values are new, on
// the game's main context and any deferred one it makes. Every few seconds in our worlds it also
// logs how many draws of each kind it saw, so a log without values still says why.

// Each effect file the game loads (.cefct_pc: its own, and the Guerrilla world's, vehicles' and

// object is at 0x26BF43C, set up by the start-up constructor 0xF58190 (0xB6BF70: +8 its name, +0xC
// the name's hash, +0x10 the size 0x1C, +0x14 its init 0xB6C0A0, +0x1C the count from push 15Eh, so
// the count is 0x26BF458). The game makes its memory pools in one go (0xD2E740, from 0xD2E5C4, after
// the mods load): it adds up count × size of every registered pool (the list at 0x2E7A6AC), allocates
// one block of that size (0xA509F0), and calls each pool's init (+0x14) with an allocator over it
// (0x2E7A710); the template pool's init allocates count × 0x1C from it and lists them all free. When
// the pool is empty, the template's allocation (0xB6C120) gives none and the effect-file loader
// (0xB5AC10) calls into it at 0xB5AC28: the game crashes. Armageddon's own preloaded effects take about
// 200 and the Guerrilla world's 150 more; a zone's characters loading theirs filled it (a crash at
// rfg_10_08 after 300-odd effect files, 2026-11-06). The mod wraps the pools' set-up and raises the
// count before it adds up the sizes, so the block and the pool are both made for 1024 (a value in the
// game's data, not its code; raising it any later would make the pool bigger than its share of the block).
//
// The emitters of the effects those templates hold come from pools of their own, made the same way: a
// template's load gives each emitter a "renderable particles" object (0xD5EDC0 from 0x306EE70, the pool
// the renderer sizes itself, see "Room for more particle emitters") and, with none left, sets the
// emitter up without one (0xB6FBAB) and then uses it unchecked (0xB6FE60, from 0xB6FF60): a crash at
// rfg_10_08 once the templates were no longer held to 350 (2026-11-06; 0x47CE1B writing 0x44). So the
// effect family's other pools are raised with the templates, threefold, each checked by its name (+8)

// ---- Guerrilla's buildings: how they hold to the ground, their materials and load, and what breaks
//
// Armageddon's destruction is Guerrilla's code, function for function: a building's pieces are joined by
// links, the pieces standing on the ground are anchored to it when the building loads, a piece cut off from
// every anchor falls, and a stress pass breaks links whose load (the weight on them times 9.8 times the
// stress control's Force_Scalar) is more than they hold. Three of its numbers are Armageddon's own:
//
// - How strongly a piece holds to the ground (rfg_destroyable_shape::create_world_anchor, 0x698F30, thiscall:
//   the shape; the mover, the piece's state; it stores the strength in the state's first word through
//   0x679E40, only for an anchored piece, the state's +0x18 bit 0). It is a damage buffer: a hit on an
//   anchored piece wears the anchor down before the piece's links take damage. Guerrilla's
//   (Re-Mars-tered 0x72FBF0) is the piece's footprint, its box's x by z (the piece's base: box from +0 to
//   +0x0C), times 256, truncated, times its material's link strength (record +0x40, LinkStrength × 1000)
//   shifted 8 left, the 64-bit product shifted 16 right; an indestructible piece (base +0x3F bit 0x20)
//   0x7FFFFFFF. Armageddon's takes the area as the piece's mass over its material's density times the box's
//   height, which comes to under 1/256 m² for every piece of both games: so every anchor's strength is
//   its floor of 1, and an anchored foundation or beam gives way at the first hit. With GuerrillaAnchors=1
//   the mod wraps the function and, after the game's, stores Guerrilla's strength (at least 1, the game's
//   own floor) for the same pieces the game set one for.
// - The materials (rfg_materials.xtbl; records of 0x5C bytes from the pointer at 0x155E10C, how many at
//   0x155E110, the name at +0, Density +0x2C, LinkStrength × 1000 +0x40, StressMultiplier +0x44). Both games'
//   tables are the same but for two: Steel-SuperStrong's links Armageddon made 5 times weaker (800, not
//   4000), with a StressMultiplier of 5 (a field Guerrilla hasn't: it multiplies a link group's yield in the
//   stress pass) to make up for it there; and Stone-Indestructo (LinkStrength 8388, Density 5000; Guerrilla's
//   2000 and 500).
// - The stress controls (rfg_stress_controls.xtbl; records of 0x34 bytes from 0x17EE5B0, how many at
//   0x17EE69C, the name at +0, Force_Scalar +0x2C): Default's Force_Scalar is 0.15 in Armageddon, 0.12 in
//   Guerrilla, so its buildings' weight is a quarter heavier.
// With GuerrillaMaterials=1 the mod puts Guerrilla's values in those records while one of our worlds is
// loaded, and the game's back when another is: each value is checked first, and one that isn't the game's is
// left alone. The game works a building's link strengths out as it loads (0x697120, thiscall: the shape),
// so the values are set there too, before the world's first building, as well as each frame.
//
// And a log (DestructionLog=1): every 10 s in our worlds, how many of each of the destruction events the
// game looked up an effect for (the material events: load_balance, stress, detach, groan, shatter,
// collapse, ...), how many pieces were anchored and with what strength, how many of the game's links
// between touching buildings are in use (rfg_mover_create_dynamic_link, 0x684A90: a pool of 0x28-byte
// links at 0x155E9A8, how many taken at 0x15685E8, the limit at 0x684CAE: 1,000; a building that touches
// another when the pool is full gets no link to it), and how long the frames and the game's physics took.
// The physics: the main loop times its Havok step (0x774110, "havok_simulate") in microseconds into
// 0x130860C (0x5417A9-0x5417BE). The game's debris balancer (rfgl, 0x67FDE0) reads it: its load is that
// time over 10 ms (Guerrilla's over 26.25 ms, Re-Mars-tered 0x715470) plus the debris made lately, and
// while the load is up it takes debris away, each with the load_balance event. So many load_balance
// events mean the physics step ran over 10 ms.
//
// The three switches are read again whenever rfa_mods.ini is saved (CheckSettings). The stress pass reads
// the materials and load as it goes, so those change at once; anchors and link strengths are worked out as
// buildings load, so `level` again loads every building with the new ones.

// ---- Guerrilla's wind turbines
//
// A turbine is three movers from one chunk: its tower (an rfg_mover), its blades (an rfg_mover, held to the tower
// by a hinge that a motor turns: the world builder places them, GuerrillaConstraints) and its motor (a
// general_mover, the nacelle, whose death plays its electric death effect and the transformer explosion).
// Guerrilla gives them code of their own (custom_object_set_callbacks, RM 0xAD9670, by level object name):
// - The tower damaged (windmill_base_damaged_callback, 0xA52520; damage above 0): its motor is watched each frame
//   (windmill_motor_do_frame_callback, 0xA2C7D0), and once it moves at 1 m/s or more (it falls with the tower),
//   it is given 1,000 damage of the level-object kind and dies.
// - The blades damaged (windmill_blade_damaged_callback, 0xA522D0): a 3 s timer starts (again at each hit), and
//   each frame (0xA51C70) 1.25 s on the motor is given the same 1,000 damage (once), and at 3 s the blades'
//   constraints are destroyed: the hinge goes and the blades fall off.
// - The blades turned to a random angle as they load (windmill_blade_stream_in_callback): done by the world builder,
//   once, in the zone.
// Armageddon has the same callbacks per mover, set by its own custom_object_set_callbacks (0x7A4650; cdecl: the
// mover, a flag): by the kind its level object's name has in its own table (the name: the level object
// properties at [mover+0xB4], whose first field's first field is the name, as at 0x7A46E3). It has no turbines,
// so ours get its plain mover callbacks. Its slots are Guerrilla's one place later: +0xBC stream-in, +0xC0
// damaged, +0xC4 destroyed. A callback is cdecl: the event (its type at +0, the object's handle at +4; damage is
// type 0, with the share of damage at +8, Guerrilla's building_damaged_event) and a notify record, and returns an
// event_result (Armageddon's mover callback 0x7A4DF0: 2 when it acted, 0 when not).
// So, in our worlds, the towers' and blades' damaged slots get Guerrilla's code, which first calls the callback
// Armageddon gave them. The timers and the motor watch run in the effects' frame update. The objects come from
// the world builder's list (mods\guerrilla_world\turbines.txt: zone, tower, blades, motor, hinge), by handle.
// Damage is the game's own (apply_damage, virtual +0xA4 in Armageddon, Guerrilla's +0x88 with three more
// arguments: Armageddon's own calls pass a scale of 1 and zeros, 0x7A21C1), so the motor dies as any other.

// ---- Guerrilla's ladders
//
// A ladder is an invisible volume on a building that the player and people climb (the world builder places
// Guerrilla's, each on its building: GuerrillaLadders); Armageddon's ladder code is Guerrilla's. Two things in it
// are Armageddon's own, and in our worlds they're Guerrilla's:
//   - What a damaged building does to its ladder. Both games run a callback on a building's damage event (event 0,
//     the building's handle at +4). Guerrilla's (ladder_building_damaged_callback, RM 0xA36B10): for an rfg_mover
//     whose percent destroyed is 0 or past 2.5 %, its first ladder child is switched on if the building is whole
//     (0 %) and fixed (move type RFGM_FIXED), else off; between the two nothing changes. Armageddon's (0x7AB1D0):
//     every ladder child of a mover off once it's past 0.1 % or not fixed. So a few bullet holes, which leave
//     Guerrilla's ladder climbable, took Armageddon's away. (Armageddon switches a building's ladders back on when
//     the building comes back, 0x7AB2C0, as Guerrilla's world reset does; left as it is.)
//   - The slide's sounds. Sliding down, Guerrilla plays MOV_FOLEY_LADDER_LOOP_01 (ladder_start_slide_sound) and,
//     landing, stops it and plays MOV_FOLEY_LADDER_RELEASE_01; Armageddon's same code (0x7AAD50, 0x7AA706) posts its
//     own events, game_audio.xtbl's Slide_Down_Ladder and Slide_Down_Ladder_Land, whose ids the game keeps at
//     0x13033E0 and 0x13033E4. Each slide's start (the landing always follows one) points both at the weapons
//     build's events of Guerrilla's cues in our worlds, at Armageddon's elsewhere. (Guerrilla plays the player's
//     release in 2D; ours plays at him in 3D, which sounds the same.)

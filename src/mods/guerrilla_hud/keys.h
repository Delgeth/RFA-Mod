// Guerrilla's keys: the keys of the actions that Guerrilla's ported parts add to Armageddon (its world map, the
// backpacks, the map's zoom and pan, the safehouse screens' lists). They are kept in rfa_mods.ini under
// [GuerrillaKeys] and changed in the F7 window Guerrilla > Keys. Part of guerrilla_hud (keys.cpp).
//
// Other mods read the same settings: [GuerrillaKeys] <name>= a letter, a digit, Tab, Enter, Space or F1-F12 (empty:
// no key). A
// mod that wants to know when one changes asks guerrilla_hud.dll's GuerrillaHud_KeysVersion() (a number that goes
// up with each change made in the window), or GuerrillaHud_Key("<name>") for the key itself (its virtual-key code).

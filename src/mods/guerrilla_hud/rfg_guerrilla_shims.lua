-- What Red Faction: Guerrilla's own interface scripts use that Armageddon's interface Lua doesn't
-- have. Part of the guerrilla_hud mod: GuerrillaBuilder.exe puts this in front of each of Guerrilla's
-- scripts it brings over from your copy of Guerrilla (which is only read; nothing of it is shipped),
-- and our own script for that document after it.
--
-- Each document's script keeps the globals it makes in a table of its own (Armageddon's
-- system_lib.lua), but a global is read from whichever loaded document has it, so these are the
-- same in every document that has them. Reading a global no script defined is an error.

-- Guerrilla's name for the tween state Armageddon calls TWEEN_STATE_WAITING (both are 0).

-- Lua's string library, which the game's Lua doesn't have: find, for a plain part, from the mod.

-- Guerrilla's text sizes. Armageddon has fonts of the same names as Guerrilla's, drawn bigger (its font_body half as
-- big again as Guerrilla's; its font_header a little taller), so GuerrillaBuilder.exe scales the texts of some of
-- Guerrilla's documents by their font (Guerrilla's height over Armageddon's) and tells this script which, by the
-- document's text elements' names (rfg_text_scales, later in the document's script). A text_scale Guerrilla's script
-- sets or reads is then scaled the same way, so its script works in Guerrilla's sizes as it did.
-- All of it is local to this document's script (each document has its own copy of these shims): a global would live
-- in one document's table, gone when that document unloads, and reading or making a global that isn't there is an
-- error (2026-11-12: every document's script stopped on one, and the game crashed).

// Red Faction: Guerrilla's HUD in the worlds ported from Guerrilla, Armageddon's own everywhere else.
//
// Both games build their HUD from the same kind of interface documents (VINT: elements driven by a
// Lua script). Armageddon loads its HUD (the document ui_hud) once at start-up and keeps it through
// every world. This mod adds Guerrilla's HUD documents on top of it while a world named by
// [GuerrillaHud] Worlds= is played (the ported world is "rfg"), and takes them away again in any
// other world. Each document's script (in mods\guerrilla_hud\) fades out the parts of Armageddon's
// HUD it replaces while it is loaded, and back in when it is unloaded.
//
// The documents are Guerrilla's own, made loadable by GuerrillaBuilder.exe from the player's own copy
// of Guerrilla (never shipped): see RfaFormats\Interface\GuerrillaHud.cs. Without them the mod only
// says so in the log.
//
// When: the HUD's data update (0x57BC30), which the HUD's per-frame process (0x57B520) calls every
// frame while the HUD is up, is wrapped. After the game's own update the mod looks at the world's
// name (kept in the world object, 0x1870630, at +0x29EA, as the time of day reads it to name its
// files) and loads or unloads the documents the way the game loads its menus while playing, putting
// them in a draw list of the interface as the console's vint_doc_load does (a document that is in
// none is loaded but never drawn). The interface's draw pass (0x564FF0) is wrapped too: our
// documents stay on the draw list only while the HUD is being updated, so nothing of them is left
// on loading screens or in the menus. And the start of every level load (0x55D870) is wrapped:
// all of our documents are unloaded there, as the load frees their memory (see LoadStart).
//
// Guerrilla's map ([GuerrillaHud] Map=1): its minimap (the document rfg_ui_hud) and its world map
// (rfg_ui_fullscreen, opened and closed with [GuerrillaKeys] Map=, see keys.cpp). Guerrilla drew the map itself
// in its HUD's map elements (its "cartographer"); Armageddon kept that code only for its compass. So
// here the documents' scripts build the map from pictures, Guerrilla's own: its world map picture,
// each zone's own picture, its minimap's frame, mask and player arrow. What they need to know each
// frame, this mod tells them through Lua functions it adds to the interface's Lua (see
// RFAMod_RegisterLua): where the player is on Guerrilla's map, which way the camera looks, the
// district, and which zones' pictures are loaded. Those come as Guerrilla keeps them, each zone's
// picture on its own (here a document that only brings that texture), loaded while the player is
// near.

// ---- Guerrilla's weapon cabinet: a safehouse's weapon locker, and every ammo crate
//
// Guerrilla's weapon cabinet (hud_ui_weapon_cabinet_*, its game state GS_INGAME_WEAPON_CABINET, its document
// rfg_ui_safehouse_weapons) opens two ways: at a safehouse's locker (its object_action_node "Player Open Weapon
// Cabinet": player::do_frame_action_node RM 0xAC25AA, show(false)) and at any ammo crate (player_use_ammo_box,
// player::do_frame_open_ammo_box RM 0xACD6A6, show(true), but during a Demolitions Master activity, which refills
// at once). Its rules, as kept here:
//   - The list (Guerrilla's Weapon_list: weapon and whether bought, in the order found; hud_ui_weapon_cabinet_save
//     keeps it in the save): every weapon the player carries as it opens (add_inventory_items RM 0x87CBC0), picks
//     up (pick_up_cb), buys (player_meta_data::purchase_upgrade: a "Weapon" upgrade's weapon) or a mission gives,
//     unlocked; and each weapon a "Weapon" upgrade not bought yet but on sale sells, locked ("PURCHASE AT UPGRADE
//     TABLE"; hud_ui_upgrades_update_list RM 0x87C950). Never the sledgehammers (class melee_sledgehammer) or a
//     non-inventory weapon. The singularity bomb is passed over unless carried.
//   - The screen: seven of the list at a time around the one picked, its name, the ammo it will have, its upgrades
//     bought, its team's logo, "n / count"; the four slots below with their weapons and ammo. The list runs top to
//     bottom, the next weapon below the one picked. Keys here: W / S, the arrows or the mouse wheel pick (S, down
//     and the wheel down the next); 1, 2 and 3 put the weapon picked into that slot (Guerrilla's
//     process_input RM 0x85A300: a weapon already in another of the three swaps places with the slot's; the
//     fourth slot is Mason's hammer and never changes); Esc, Tab or Backspace close it (Guerrilla's back).
//   - Its HUD is hidden while it's open (hud_ui_unload_items on enter): here ours and Armageddon's (the script).
//   - Ammo, as it closes (exit RM 0x85AFA0, weapon_cabinet_get_ammo_box_ammo RM 0x85A170), for each gun carried
//     that uses ammo: at a locker, full (Max_Rounds, or Max_Rounds_Upgrade with its "Weapon" upgrade's value 2
//     bought) and "FULL AMMO" said; at a crate, what it had as the cabinet opened (none for a gun taken from it)
//     plus Ammo_Box_Restock × the district's morale's share (Guerrilla's table, by tenths) × the difficulty's
//     "player ammo crates", up to full. A "never in cabinet" gun keeps its ammo; melee has none.
//   - An ammo crate opens once (player::open_ammo_box RM 0xA846E0): opening it uses it up until its zone loads it
//     again (see UseUpAmmoCrate). A locker opens as often as wanted, full each time.
// The game is paused while it's open (as the shop), and only its screen is drawn. Here the list is kept in
// mods\guerrilla_hud\cabinet_weapons.txt, one for every save (as the upgrades bought are), and the weapons carried
// are looked at every second (pickups, purchases). Armageddon's inventory: the record in a slot (0x7A8290), the
// game's own delete of a record (0x85C6A0, as its swap 0x8BEB00 calls it) and add into a slot (0x85B260). Not here
// yet: Mason's walk to the crate and its opening animation (the crate's lid, Weap_RM), the cabinet's sounds, the
// singularity bomb's warning, the morale system (the district's morale at the start is used).

// guerrilla_handbook.xtbl (handbook.txt, GuerrillaBuilder.exe's), a page for each category, only the pages with an
// entry open (hud_ui_handbook_count_viewable_pages) and only the open entries on them. An entry is open from the
// start (Unlocked) or once the game opens it (hud_ui_handbook_unlock_entry): here, by what this mod keeps already:
//   - a weapon in the weapon cabinet's list (found, bought or on sale) opens the entry of its Guerrilla name
//     (hud_ui_weapon_cabinet_add_weapon RM 0x877200: unlock_entry(crc of the weapon's name));
//   - a radio tag found opens the radio tags' page's ("BLAST FROM THE PAST") entry of its number
//     (bftp_touch_tag RM 0xA8DBB2: hud_ui_handbook_unlock_bftp_entry(the tag's number)).
// Not yet: the activities' starts (activity_base::activity_initialize opens theirs), the tool tips, the cutscenes;
// the videos (gameplay, cutscenes) and the radio tags' recordings and portraits.
// An entry not read yet is marked new (its page too) until it's shown (handbook_entry_set_viewed): the entries read
// are kept in mods\guerrilla_hud\handbook_read.txt, one list for every save (as the cabinet's list).
// It opens from Armageddon's pause menu (rfg_handbook_open: the game stays paused, held by this mod, as the pause
// menu closes), and its back key (Esc, Tab or Backspace) closes it and opens the pause menu again, as Guerrilla's

// game code fed it, which Armageddon hasn't, so here is what our script needs (RM: ui_process_primary_messages 0x8E8890,
// ui_process_secondary_messages 0x8E8E50, hud_ui_add_item_pickup_message 0x895700, hud_ui_process_use_action_info
// 0x8E9410, hud_render_pickup_message 0x8550C0 with hud_ui_set_swap_data 0x8B1EA0, ui_process_save_data 0x8B96F0):
//   - message lines: the major line in the middle (Guerrilla's primary messages) and the minor line at the top left
//     (its secondary ones), each 3 s unless given. Ours go to the script through rfg_message_next while the document
//     is up (Armageddon's message line otherwise); Armageddon's own lines (its messages_hud) the script takes itself.
//   - pickups: Guerrilla lists what is picked up beside the reticle, at most three rows at once: salvage (its total,
//     with "+N" over it from 3 up), a weapon picked up, rounds picked up ("+ N"), each with its picture; the same single
//     thing picked up again while its row shows adds to that row. Here they're seen as they happen: the salvage and
//     the carried weapons' rounds looked at each HUD update (not while a safehouse's screen or the world map is up,
//     nor just after: what those give isn't picked up, as Guerrilla's cabinet gave its ammo without rows).
//   - the use prompt: Guerrilla's use action (t_usable_object, which Armageddon kept with its own text after it, at
//     the player's +0x1540) names its prompt's picture (use_object_icon: 1 a hand, 2 a hydrogen tank, 3 a ladder, 4 a
//     vehicle, 5 a mission's start, 10 the upgrades; 0 a weapon to swap). Its prompt shows for any of 1-10 on foot;
//     the safehouses' stations are ours (see above), and the start of one of Guerrilla's activities is the
//     guerrilla_campaign mod's (GuerrillaCampaign_UsePrompt, when it has one). Guerrilla's prompts replace
//     Armageddon's ("[E] Enter" at a car, 2026-11-12): its own shows only for an action they have no picture for.
//   - the weapon swap: icon 0 at a weapon on the ground (Armageddon's search, 0x8B29F0, gives it when no slot is free;
//     the weapon to drop is 0x8BE980's): the held weapon's picture and rounds, an arrow, the other's.

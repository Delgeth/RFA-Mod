// Saving in the worlds ported from Red Faction: Guerrilla ([GuerrillaSave] Worlds=, the ported world is
// "rfg").
//
// Armageddon saves its whole world into one stream in memory (the world object 0x1870630, +0x248C its
// size, 1 MB at most) and writes that stream into a save slot. Its campaign makes the stream at each
// checkpoint; its pause menu then offers SAVE GAME (the save screen writes the stream into the slot you
// pick) and LOAD CHECKPOINT (the world opened again from the stream). The rfg world is a level opened
// outside the campaign, so nothing ever made a stream there and the pause menu offered no save.
//
// Here, in those worlds:
//   - the pause menu's SAVE GAME (ui_pause_menu_pc.lua) asks the world for a save of the moment you are
//     in (rfg_save_game) and leaves the menu as Armageddon's SAVE GAME does; the menu's script waits
//     while the world makes it (rfg_save_state, a few frames: the gameplay step that makes it runs while
//     the game is paused), then opens Armageddon's own save screen, and the slot you pick gets it. LOAD
//     CHECKPOINT then goes back to the last save made. (The save screen borrows its hint bar from the
//     pause menu's document, so it is opened from there, the game's own way: opened with the menu
//     closed, its script failed on Vdo_hint_bar and the game crashed.)
//   - a save is never written into a slot on its own. Armageddon writes every checkpoint into its
//     autosave slot as soon as it is made (the save job's last step, 0x6D7000, when the world's
//     +0x2515 bit 1 says the profile owns its saves); that slot is the campaign's, so in these worlds
//     the bit is cleared and the stream stays in memory until you save it.
//   - a save of one of those worlds opens by its level's name (see OpenWorld), so that its zones get the
//     Guerrilla world's size as when the world is started; with the empty name the game gives a save,
//     the load hung.
//   - each save carries guerrilla_campaign's state (districts, morale, ...): its block, from
//     GuerrillaCampaign_SaveState when the world is saved, is added after the game's own data in the
//     save's stream, so it goes wherever the save goes (the slot you pick, LOAD CHECKPOINT). When one
//     of these worlds opens, GuerrillaCampaign_LoadState gets the save's block, or nothing (null, 0) for
//     a world started fresh; a save made before this has no block, and the campaign is left as it is.
//   - a death ends as Guerrilla's: the game-over screen (ui_failure.lua) offers CONTINUE, LOAD GAME and
//     QUIT GAME, and CONTINUE wakes Mason at a safehouse with the world as he left it. Guerrilla saved the
//     world at the death (world::save_and_continue) and loaded that save back, and loading a save out of
//     a mission puts him at the nearest safehouse of his district (save_state_finish); here the save is
//     made with him put at that safehouse (0x6DA3D0, the save's warp), then the screen's own LOAD
//     CHECKPOINT opens it. See ChooseSpot and StepRespawn below. That save is made after the death,
//     when a dead human's weapons are gone, so the weapons he had alive (noted every gameplay step) go
//     with it as a block of ours and are given back when it opens (TakeKit, GiveKit).
//
// The game's save, found in its exe:
//   world 0x6DA1B0(message, b) asks for one: +0x2514 bit 2, +0x2515 bit 0 the "Checkpoint" message,
//     bit 1 "write it into the autosave slot when done";
//   the gameplay step 0x542110 (through 0x542030 and 0x6DA0E0) starts it: +0x2514 bit 4;
//   the world's streaming (0x6D70D0) then makes it: 0x6D7E20 writes the header and the game's systems
//     (+0x2514 bit 5 while it is being made), the zone stream-out jobs the rest, and the last job's end
//     sets the size (+0x248C), the streaming state (+0x23F4) back to 0 and clears bits 4 and 5.

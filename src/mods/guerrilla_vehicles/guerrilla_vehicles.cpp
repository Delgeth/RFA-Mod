// What Red Faction: Guerrilla's vehicles need from Armageddon's engine that it doesn't do itself.
// The vehicles are made from the player's own copy of Guerrilla by GuerrillaBuilder.exe (never
// shipped): see RfaFormats\Guerrilla\GuerrillaArsenal.cs.
//
// Driving: Armageddon still has Guerrilla's driving code for the player. Its gameplay controls
// (0x4DBBD0, Guerrilla's control_gameplay_process) read the accelerator and brake as button values
// (0x4E1280, controls_get_button_analog: actions 62 veh_accelerate and 63 veh_brake) and the handbrake
// as a held button (0x4E4800: 64 veh_handbrake), and turn them into the car's accelerator, brake pedal
// and handbrake (0x5F25E0, 0x5F2320, 0x5F2500), as Guerrilla does; steering comes from the veh_steer
// axis. But Armageddon's PC controls give those three actions no key: it has no car-driving scheme
// on PC (only on foot, exo, walker/tank and flyer, ui_options_controller_pc.lua), so a car's throttle
// stays at 0 and the player sits in it without moving. Guerrilla's own PC defaults (its
// control_config_populate_with_defaults, keyboard table) are W to accelerate, S to brake and reverse,
// Space for the handbrake.
//
// Getting out and changing seats: in a vehicle the game's use button is the vehicle action (0x4E1B70
// picks it: 31 of_action on foot, 60 exo_action in an exo, 86 veh_action in a vehicle, 97
// veh_flyer_action in a flyer), which gets the player out through the vehicle's interaction, and 90
// veh_change_seat moves them to another seat. Armageddon's PC defaults (six tables from 0xF7F078,
// action, key, mouse button) give neither a key (its walkers and tank are left by script), so the
// player gets into a car with E and can't get out. Guerrilla's are E for the vehicle action (as on
// foot) and the third mouse button for changing seats.
//
// The mod gives each of these actions its key or mouse button ([GuerrillaVehicles] Accelerate=,
// Brake=, Handbrake=, Exit=, ChangeSeat=: a key's name as the console's controls_show_key_bindings
// prints it, or Mouse1..Mouse7) whenever the game builds its key map from the bindings (0x4E86E0), if
// it has neither; one the player has bound is left as it is.
//
// The bindings: one control set per player (0xCF0 bytes from 0x11BEBA0), 139 button actions of 20
// bytes (+0 the gamepad button, +8 the keyboard key as a DirectInput scancode, 0 for none, +0xC the
// mouse button, 0 to 6 (0 the left, 1 the middle, 2 the right), -1 for none: as the defaults are written,
// 0x4E5CA0), then the axis actions.
// The game's names for keys are a table of 256 strings at 0x1121900, by scancode.
//
// Room for Guerrilla's animation sets: each vehicle's interaction plays an animation set (getting in,
// driving, getting out), and the game keeps every set in one table of 140 (MAX_ANIM_SETS; 20 bytes a
// set, from 0x26321B8). Armageddon fills 125 of them itself (its 50 set files and one set for each of
// its 75 animated objects, anim_rig_objects.xtbl), so only 15 of Guerrilla's vehicles' 24 fit; one
// more stops the game at start-up ("Num_anim_sets < MAX_ANIM_SETS") and it crashes. The table is a
// global the game's code reaches by its address, written into 34 instructions (the set loaders,
// anim_set_find, the people's animation code: as the table's start, or its first set's fields at +4,
// +8 and +0xC), and its size into five (the four loaders' checks and the start-up constructor that
// builds it). No one function holds it, so the mod moves it: a table of 255 sets of its own, each of
// those instructions given its address instead (and the five the new size), all of them checked
// against the game's values first and none changed if one differs. Mods start while the game's main
// thread waits at its entry point, before its start-up code, so the game's own constructor then builds
// the new table, and nothing has used the old one. 255, as set numbers may be kept in a byte.
//
// Room for Guerrilla's vehicles: the game keeps every vehicle the vehicle table describes in one list
// of 40 (0x148BD08: the entries, how many it holds, how many it has; 0x880 bytes an entry, kept right
// after it). Its start-up constructor (0x6270C0) builds the 40 there, and a list that is full can't
// grow (0x7476F0 says no), so the table's reader (0x6309C0) drops every vehicle after the 40th without
// a word. Armageddon fills 24 itself, so only 16 of Guerrilla's fit. The game's code reaches the
// entries only through the list, never at their place after it, so the mod builds the list itself in
// place of that constructor: 255 entries of its own, each built by the game's constructor for one
// (0x627100), and the list set up with them (0x47CE00). The list's destructor does nothing.
//
// Each vehicle in the list also takes, for as long as the game runs, one of the animation library's
// entity bone infos (anim_lib_instance_manager: added by 0xD7B600 when the vehicle table is read, by
// the vehicle's number), from the same table of 138 the people and animated objects take theirs from
// while they are about (0x240 bytes each from 0x323BD50, how many are taken at 0x3393360). With every
// one taken the game asserts ("Out of animlib_entity_bone_infos", nothing in this build) and writes
// through a null pointer. Only four small functions use the table (add, remove, clear, find), each
// with its address and its size, 138, in its code, so the mod moves it as it does the animation sets:
// a table of 512 of its own (Armageddon's 24 vehicles and Guerrilla's 118 leave the others more than
// they had), the four addresses and the five sizes changed after checking them. The game clears the
// table (every entry free, -1) while it starts, after the mods.
//
// Room for the animations' triggers: an animation's triggers (when a door starts to open, a foot
// lands, the camera moves; each anim_files.xtbl entry's <Triggers>) are kept in one pool of 5750 for
// every animation (8 bytes each, a trigger and its time, from 0x34BB9B8; how many are taken at
// 0x34C6D68), which the animation library adds them to as it reads the table (0xD89D40, from
// 0xD877B0). Once it is full, every animation after gets none, without a word. Armageddon's own and
// Guerrilla's come to about 7000, so the cars after the APCs had no "door start", and getting in
// stopped at the door. Only that function reaches the pool, by its address and its size, so the mod
// moves it: a pool of 16384 of its own, the one address and the one size changed after checking them.
//
// Guerrilla's vehicles' own skeletons: the game loads every skeleton (.rig_pc) its archives list while
// it starts (0x973460, from the start-up sequence: the list, then each through 0x973550), up to 290
// (its table of loaded skeletons, 0x48 bytes each from 0x34F5808; Armageddon has 178). A vehicle
// whose table entry names one (Rig: walkers, flyers, turret trucks) takes it from that table when the
// vehicle table is read (0x62F1C0, through 0xD8A010), with no check: one that isn't loaded stops the
// game. Guerrilla's vehicles' own are new files (GuerrillaArsenal writes them, and their names in
// mods\guerrilla_vehicles\rigs.txt), in no archive's list, so the mod wraps the start-up loading and
// has the game load each of them by name after its own (0x973550, cdecl, the file's name: it opens the
// file by name, where the loader finds a new file).
//
// Room for Guerrilla's vehicles in the world: Armageddon holds fewer of them than Guerrilla. Its object
// pools are made by start-up constructors, each carving its slots out of a buffer inside the pool
// object sized for its count (0x71C5D0 sets the pool up, a memory pool is made on the buffer, 0x428240,
// and the pool's fill takes from it each slot's object, handle and byte); Armageddon made two smaller
// than Guerrilla's: the vehicle spawn nodes (parked vehicles' spots) 12 (Guerrilla 128; constructor
// 0x805710) and the cars 16 at once (Guerrilla 32; 0x5F97F0). The mod replaces both constructors with
// ones doing the same on buffers of its own: Guerrilla's 128 spawn nodes, and 64 cars (twice Guerrilla's,
// at the user's ask: cars.h; 24,045 bytes a car, 1.47 MB in all). And every vehicle model the vehicle
// table names takes one of the vehicle resource pool's records (0x1972900, built by the start-up code at
// 0xF29510 and 0xF29550 on a static array of 84); once they are all taken, a model gets none and its
// vehicles never spawn, without a word; Armageddon's and Guerrilla's models together are more than 84.
// The mod builds the records on an array of 255 of its own (the 16 models streamed at once stay the
// game's). The constructors' values are checked first, and nothing changed if one differs.
//
// Room for Guerrilla's walkers' blend trees: Armageddon keeps every blend tree (its .blend_treex files,
// listed in blendTree_filenames.xtbl) in a table of 24, and its own fill 23 of them (the loader stops at
// the 24th), so Guerrilla's walkers' trees (GuerrillaWalkerTrees) wouldn't fit. The table is a global the
// start-up constructor builds, its address in four instructions and its size in two, so the mod moves it
// as it does the animation sets: a table of 64 of its own, checked first, before the constructor runs.
//
// A vehicle is made only once its model has streamed in (object_spawn_vehicle, 0x761790: refused, 2,
// unless the model's record is reserved or in use; then "not yet", 1, until it has streamed in). Where a
// spawn resource is in force (our worlds, as Wrecking Crew's levels) the game streams only the models
// the resource holds, so Guerrilla's parked vehicles' spots and its traffic would be refused for good.
// Guerrilla chose its streamed vehicles by what was wanted near the player. The mod wraps that spawn:
// one refused for want of its model reserves it in the resource in force (0x761DC0, cdecl: category 8,
// owner 3, the vehicle's entry, as the game's own reservations and the Spawn menu's; it makes room only by
// letting go of a reservation nothing uses, 16 models at most) and says "not yet", so the spot asks again
// until it has streamed in. It reserves only while the resource is in force (state 4): while the game is
// changing to a new one (1-3, as after a reload) a model reserved can't stream yet, and the change waits
// for everything it doesn't want to be let go (see "What the spawn pools hold"); the spawn is "not yet".
//
// Guerrilla's lights (GuerrillaVehicleLights: each light linked to a vehicle_lights row of its type, its
// glow Guerrilla's): Armageddon turns a vehicle's lights on and off by its own rules (0x61BA60 each frame,
// 0x61B280 only when the headlight state or the half-second blink changes): headlights by the driver, tail
// lights off while braking, steady running lights. Guerrilla's (vehicle_effects_process_lights): every
// frame; headlights and fog lights while the engine runs at night (18:00 to 6:00 by the game clock, at first
// sight as the hour says, then changing at a random moment within the hour), tail lights with the brake
// light's glow while braking, else as the headlights; brake lights while braking, reverse lights while
// reversing, emergency lights blinking every half second, strobes while the engine runs. The mod wraps
// 0x61BA60: a vehicle with lights of Guerrilla's rows gets Guerrilla's rules, through the game's own
// steps for turning a light on (0x5FB700), swapping its glow, and off (0x5FB920); breaking stays the game's.
//
// Guerrilla's engine sounds (GuerrillaVehicleSounds builds them): each frame the game sets four game
// parameters on a vehicle's engine sound (0x5FABA0, cdecl: the sound, then SPEED, RPM, ENGINE_LOAD and
// DAMAGE, from the vehicle's sounds' frame 0x5FA1F0), which Guerrilla's engine layers follow. Guerrilla's
// own audio code eased the load toward the game's, 0.12 of the way every 10 ms, and played the player's
// own vehicle's stereo loops in 2D, the others' mono loops in 3D. The mod replaces that function with one
// doing the same and also easing the load as Guerrilla did, and setting RFG_PLAYER_IN_VEHICLE (1 for the
// vehicle the player is in: the game's own check, 0x605550, made in a wrapper of the frame), which the
// banks' two sets of loops fade on. Armageddon's own engines read neither.
//
// Dents: Guerrilla's cars crumple where they are hit, by a morph target in the vehicle's file (46 of its
// 74 have one; GuerrillaArsenal carries it over). Armageddon kept the whole of it, Guerrilla's code as
// it was: the vehicle loader reads the morph target (0x622110 → 0xD40580) and makes the vehicle's dent
// container (0xC2BC10), and the impact code (0x60F590) dents it (0x619810), but only while
// vehicle_deformation_enabled is on (a bool at 0x142A484, also the console's toggle of that name),
// which Guerrilla starts on and Armageddon off (none of its vehicles has a morph target, so for them
// nothing changes). The mod turns it on while the game starts ([GuerrillaVehicles] Dents=1, before
// any vehicle is loaded: the loader reads it then), after checking that the three instructions that
// read it (the toggle, the loader, the impact code) still name it.
//
// Doors: getting in, a person's step "Open Door" opens the vehicle's door (vi_door_open_action,
// 0x654AA0, Guerrilla's 0xBA1520), which records it among the vehicle's open doors (six records of 16
// bytes from the pointer at the interaction instance's +4: when, the door part, its state, the
// waypoint it was opened from), and every frame the interaction closes a door recorded open 2.5 s
// after it opened once nobody stands at that waypoint, 4 s at most (0x657500, Guerrilla's
// vehicle_interaction_process). Armageddon kept all of it as Guerrilla had it. A door recorded open is
// never opened again (the open action only refreshes the record), so if the door part has shut while
// its record still says open, a person climbs through the shut door: seen on Guerrilla's taxi. The
// mod wraps the open action: before it runs, a door of the transition that is shut (latched to the
// body, its opening at most 0.03) but still recorded open has its record cleared (0x64C140, and any
// person's note of it), so the game opens it and records it afresh, as Guerrilla would.
//
// A door's opening is measured from its turn against the vehicle (0x6134A0, Guerrilla's
// vehicle_component::get_unlatched_door_t_value): the turn's axis and angle (matrix::
// extract_axis_and_angle), over the hinge's most. For a shut door the turn is next to none, and its
// axis comes out next to nothing; Guerrilla's extract_axis_and_angle (RM 0x5A10C0) then calls it no
// turn (angle 0), Armageddon's (0xC9C8A0) a half turn (angle pi). So, depending on which way the
// vehicle faces, a shut door just unlatched to open measured pi over its 90 degrees, 2: fully open;
// the game ended the opening at once, the door never moved, and the person climbed through it (the
// second time into Guerrilla's taxi). The mod replaces the door's measurement with Guerrilla's, its
// axis and angle worked out as Guerrilla's are (the game's matrix and angle helpers otherwise); the
// shared math function stays Armageddon's for everything else. With
// [GuerrillaVehicles] DoorLog=1 (off unless set; not in the ini template) it also logs every door
// opening and closing, each latch and unlatch, and each change of a door part's state.

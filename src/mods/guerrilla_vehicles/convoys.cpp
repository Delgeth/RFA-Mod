// Guerrilla's EDF convoys in its world (object_convoy, its spawner and its lead and follow driving, which
// Armageddon deleted), ported onto the code Armageddon kept. A part of guerrilla_vehicles.dll.
// GuerrillaBuilder.exe writes mods\guerrilla_vehicles\convoys.txt: each convoy's convoys.xtbl row (Destroy or
// Capture, difficulty, normal and evade speeds, its hours), its end point (where it sets off) and members in
// order (role, how many people, the vehicles of its group), and its route along the roads.
//
// Starting, as Guerrilla's activity spawner offers them (do_activity_spawn_frame 0x7A83F0, convoys'
// collect_spawn_objects 0x780DA0, as after the campaign: any convoy): every 4 to 6 s, one convoy at a time,
// the end point nearest the player that is more than 150 m from it, whose hours (tod_info) include the game's
// hour and which hasn't sent one in the last 10 minutes; none in the first [GuerrillaVehicles]
// ConvoyWaitAfterLoad= seconds in the world (600, Guerrilla's: an end point loads with its 10 minutes set).
// Its crews are EDF people of the zone's spawn resource (crews.txt), as many as its squad has (1, 2, 4 or 7;
// at most the seats).
//
// While nobody is near, the convoy is a point moving along its route at its normal speed (Guerrilla simulates
// far squads); once that point is within 300 m of the player its vehicles are made on the route, the lead
// furthest ahead and each next one 20 m behind (Guerrilla's spawn 0xA61F20), and taken away again (back to
// the point) if they all get 450 m from the player out of view before it is attacked.
//
// Driving (lead_convoy_patrol_action, ai_vehicle_do_follow_frame): only drivers sit frames out (gunners fire
// with their own AI). The lead drives to the next route point (passed within 20 m, looking 3 ahead), on the
// roads, stopping 10 m short, at the convoy's speed (its evade speed once attacked), halving it while a gap
// between two of its vehicles is over 30 m and stopping while one is over 50 m (not once attacked). Each
// follower aims at the point on the route 20 m behind the vehicle ahead, at that vehicle's speed + 0.5 × how
// far its place is ahead of it − 0.4 (the convoy's speed + 5 m/s while more than 12.5 m off it; braking at
// 1 m/s or less), stopping 5 m short with no braking at the end.
//
// Attacked (update_attacked_status: a vehicle at least 1 % damaged with its crew fighting the player or the
// player near, or someone of it killed or a vehicle lost): the evade speed; its Break and Attack vehicles leave
// the convoy and chase the player (crews.cpp); a Capture convoy's target's crew gets out, so the player can
// take it. Ending: at the route's end the targets stay parked, their crews out to guard them, and the others go
// once out of sight; with no vehicle left it's over. Which wins and rewards are the campaign's.

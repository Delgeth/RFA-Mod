// Getting into and out of a vehicle in Guerrilla's world, as Guerrilla lets the player. A part of
// guerrilla_vehicles.dll.
//
// Both games pick the player's use action (the prompt, and what the use key does: pick something up, open a
// door, get into a vehicle, ...) only from the kinds of action his state allows: a mask of kinds, kind n allowed
// when bit n is set (Armageddon: player +0x27C4, tested by 0x8BFF20 for player_process_object_interaction
// 0x8BF830; Guerrilla: player +0x24B0, player_is_usable_object_allowed RM 0xA103A0). Kind 6 is getting into a
// vehicle. Each frame the game sets the masks for the player's state (a table of functions from 0xF7C028).
//
// Guerrilla's standing player has kind 6 (set_control_permissions_stand, RM 0x6FBCC0: 0x7FFF8; only while he
// carries something that isn't in his inventory, 0x7FF88, without it). Armageddon's on-foot permissions
// (0x4D8830: 0x57F84 or 0x31FBC) leave it out: its own player gets into a vehicle only by script. Nothing in
// Armageddon puts it back but the console's Controls_use_vehicle_enabled (0x11BE7F0, off), a debug switch that
// adds it in every state, in a vehicle too.
//
// Getting out goes through the same bit. In a vehicle the use key is the vehicle action (Exit=,
// guerrilla_vehicles.cpp), and the game's use handler (0x4E12B0) gets the player out (player_use_vehicle 0x8B9680
// → vehicle_interaction_request_exit 0x656A20, which picks the normal or quick exit) only if bit 6 is set.
// Guerrilla's handler (control_gameplay_just_pressed_action, RM 0x6F7210) asks nothing: in a vehicle the action
// always calls player_use_vehicle. Armageddon's in-vehicle permissions (0x4D9840, and 0x4D9BB0 for the states
// around it) set the mask to nothing (bit 6 only with the console switch), so the player couldn't get out.
// Adding bit 6 there offers nothing else: in a vehicle the use-target search stops before it looks for
// vehicles (0x8BFA0F).
//
// So in the worlds Guerrilla's rules run in ([GuerrillaVehicles] TrafficWorlds=, rfg), single player:
//   - on foot, when the game has given the player its on-foot permissions (those with kind 7, using things),
//     kind 6 is added, as Guerrilla's standing player has it;
//   - in a vehicle, bit 6 is added, so the vehicle action gets him out, as Guerrilla's.

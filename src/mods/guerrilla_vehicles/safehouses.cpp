// Guerrilla's safehouses' parked vehicles: a safehouse's spots filled again when the player walks into it, as
// Guerrilla's. A part of guerrilla_vehicles.dll, run each frame from traffic's hook on the spawn nodes' frame.
//
// Guerrilla has no menu to take a car from: each safehouse (object_safehouse) owns vehicle spawn nodes, the spots
// where its cars stand (up to 4; its zone attaches them to it), and an area (a trigger_region, a box or a
// sphere). Each frame (safehouse_do_frame_postsim, RM 0xA93B40) it finds the enabled safehouse whose area holds
// the player; on the frame he comes into one from outside any, that safehouse's spots are filled again
// (object_safehouse::respawn_vehicles, RM 0xA93AF0), each by object_safehouse_try_vehicle_spawn (RM 0xA931C0):
//   - its car still within sqrt(4000) = 63 m of its spot (Safehouse_respawn_vehicle_dist_squared): nothing;
//   - its car farther, and the player within 63 m of it: nothing (he's using it or near it);
//   - its car farther and the player not near it: that car is taken away (world::destroy_object) and a new one
//     made at the spot;
//   - no car, or a wreck: a new one made at the spot, unless a vehicle or the player is within 5 m of it.
// A new car is the node's own spawn (spawn_child_object): one of the node's group, empty. Between visits the spots
// work as every other node's (both games make a node's car as the player comes within 250 m). A car whose model
// isn't streamed in yet is asked for and made by the game's spawn step as soon as it is (see PickFromGroup in
// guerrilla_vehicles.cpp): "waiting" in the log.
//
// Armageddon has no safehouse class, and the world build places Guerrilla's nodes without their parent link, so
// GuerrillaBuilder.exe writes which spots are whose and each safehouse's area: mods\guerrilla_vehicles\
// safehouses.txt. The game's node for a spot is the one standing on it (within half a metre: the world build
// keeps Guerrilla's positions).
//
// Guerrilla also keeps its ambient people off a safehouse's spots (object_vehicle_spawn_node::allow_ambient_action,
// RM 0xA3E790: no ambient driver parks there, no ambient walker takes its car). Those ambient actions are part of
// the population layer Armageddon deleted and the mods haven't ported, so nothing takes or parks at a spot yet;
// whatever ports them must skip these spots.
//
// One difference, for safety: a car of a spot with someone aboard is never taken away (Guerrilla's would be).

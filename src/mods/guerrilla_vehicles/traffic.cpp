// Guerrilla's traffic in its world: its ambient vehicle spawner (amb_spawn's do_frame_spawn_vehicle and
// spawn_single_vehicle, despawn), which Armageddon deleted, ported onto the code Armageddon kept. A part of
// guerrilla_vehicles.dll. GuerrillaBuilder.exe writes what it needs: mods\guerrilla_vehicles\traffic.txt (each
// zone's vehicle group, its traffic's density by day and by night, its spawn resource; each group's
// vehicles) and mods\guerrilla_people\crews.txt (each resource's people by side, the people part's).
//
// Spawning, as Guerrilla's: every 250 to 500 ms (2 to 4 s after a spawn), in the world named in
// [GuerrillaVehicles] TrafficWorlds= (rfg), while the player's zone has traffic: up to its cap (Guerrilla's
// table at green alert: none, low 4, medium 6, high 10; the night's density from 18:00 to 6:00 by the game
// clock), a car of the zone's group on an ambient road (a road whose file flag 1 is set: Armageddon keeps it
// as bit 2 of the road's flags, +0xB4) 60 to 260 m from the player, not within 30 m of another, facing
// along the road on its right side; a model already streamed in first, else one the game is asked to
// stream (guerrilla_vehicles' spawn reserves it). Its people: 1 to 3 (as many as it has seats) of the zone's
// resource's civilians and guerrillas (the people the game streams there), made in the car's place
// (0x762D50, drop_human's) and put straight into their seats (vehicle_interaction_request_enter 0x656410,
// teleporting, as Guerrilla's do_npc_spawn_vehicle: the driver first).
//
// Driving: Armageddon has no order or goal that drives an NPC along roads to a place (drive_to_location's
// flags are read by nothing), so the mod drives its traffic's drivers itself every frame, as Guerrilla's
// ambient_veh_drive_action did: each occupant's AI told to sit this frame out (its ai_system's
// yield_next_frame, +0x651 bit 2: the planner, perception and firing skip it; death doesn't), the car's AI
// in its pathfind state at 9 m/s (AMBIENT_VEHICLE_SPEED), and ai_vehicle_travel_to_a_point_do_frame
// (0x4B18E0, Guerrilla's 0x68B1F0) toward a road destination 150 m or more ahead (the game's own
// ai_vehicle_pick_flee_destination_road, 0x4B2BD0: a flood along the roads), with roads on (it routes along
// them: the road splines' A*, lanes, the vehicle navigation at the ends), stopping 10 m short, a new
// destination within 20 m of it. A car whose driver is gone or out (shot, pulled out, the player took it)
// is handed back to the game.
//
// Reactions, as Guerrilla's: the drivers count as ambient (npc +0x1700 = 1, NPC_MANAGER_AMBIENT, which
// Armageddon never sets), so the game's own avoidance inside travel_to sets Guerrilla's ambient waits (a
// person or the player ahead, the player's car, a queue: 500 to 1500 ms; vehicle AI +0x3F1C, the blocker at
// +0x3F18); while one runs the car brakes (vehicle_set_controls_when_abandoned 0x610820) and may honk
// (civilian_horn_do_honk's rule: 20% a honk of 500 to 2000 ms, else 10 to 15 s before the next roll). A
// driver with a flee belief (ai_get_flee_to_safety_belief 0x483C90: an explosion, damage, a bullet impact,
// combat sounds within 10 s, 30 s for civilians; ai_get_enemy_flee_belief 0x483B00) drives off at its
// car's full speed (the 9 m/s cap cleared), away from the threat, stopping only for the player on foot.
// A car on fire, wrecked or flipped: its people get out (at once if it burns, else once it's nearly
// stopped: 1.5 m/s) and run (npc::start_active_despawn 0x8AAEC0, Armageddon's own "run, then vanish").
// No new car while the world has more than 90 people or 28 cars (Guerrilla's caps). Despawning, as
// Guerrilla's should_despawn_vehicle: a car more than 60 m away whose driver has been out of view 5 s,
// 20 s after it was made (10 s if it's beyond the 260 m ring); any car 280 m away; its people first.

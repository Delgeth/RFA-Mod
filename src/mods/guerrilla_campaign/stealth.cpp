// Guerrilla's stealth rule, which Armageddon dropped.
//
// In Guerrilla every piece of AI asks one function whom a human is fighting: human_combat_get_target
// (0xA2F920 in Re-Mars-tered, 143 callers: aiming, firing, moving, choosing cover, ...). It returns the
// human behind the fighter's combat target handle, except in single player (not Wrecking Crew, no DLC):
// when that target is the local player and he is fully stealthed (human_is_player_in_stealth 0xA2F8F0:
// his backpack's multi_object_backpack::is_stealth_active), an EDF (team 1) or Marauder (team 3) fighter
// gets no target at all. The fighter keeps its handle and its beliefs; it just has nobody to fight while
// the stealth lasts, and has him again the moment it ends.
//
// Armageddon kept the getter (0x880B70, cdecl: the human; the human behind its +0xF8C, through the world's
// human-by-handle 0x436120; 157 callers) without the stealth test. Here it is wrapped and the test put back
// in our worlds. The stealth state is guerrilla_gear's (GuerrillaGear_PlayerStealthed: 1 while the Stealth
// backpack has the player fully stealthed).

// What Guerrilla's alert level hears from the world, read off Armageddon's objects.
//
// Guerrilla's alert rises by what the EDF sees and loses (gfm_alert, its "alm" and "gsm" functions):
// - Its people who see the player: in green, each of the EDF's people (anyone whose team is friendly
//   to the EDF or better) who has a player in sight (a "first contact" belief of one, ai_perception::
//   any_enemy_player_in_los), has a target, and may engage it (can_engage_target_reason) adds 75 a
//   second; at any level, one such holds the alert's decay off. "May engage" is Guerrilla's reach by
//   alert level, 30, 40, 60, 80 m from green to red (its Ai_engage_distance values, in its code), twice
//   that when the soldier is in a vehicle or the target in a flyer. Guerrilla's other answers there
//   aren't ported yet: a squad under attack orders engages at any range (the reinforcements' squads
//   will), a turret's crew at 2.5 times, and at most so many attack the player at once.
// - Its dead (human_died → alm_report_human_death): each of its people who dies within 200 m of the
//   player while the alert is above green, whoever killed them, is reported once, as full damage to
//   someone of low importance (what every person on a side is, unless a zone says otherwise).
// - Its vehicles (vehicle_apply_damage → alm_report_vehicle_damage, vehicle_blow_up →
//   alm_report_vehicle_death): damage to a vehicle with someone in it, whose last driver was the
//   EDF's, counts above green; a wrecked vehicle of the EDF's own (its vehicles.xtbl Default_Team)
//   counts at any level. Guerrilla leaves out damage done by the EDF's own people; this port can't tell
//   who did it, as it reads each vehicle's damage every frame instead of hooking the game's damage
//   functions, so that counts too.
// - Its buildings (rfg_mover::serialize → sdc_create_damage_tracking_report, rfg_mover::
//   do_frame_report → sdc_report_new_damage, sdc_do_frame): every building of the EDF's (its gameplay
//   properties' team) with an importance above none has a report, which holds the most damage the
//   building has had (its damage percentage: how much of its structural mass is gone; 1 once it is
//   dead) and stops following once the building counts as destroyed in the game (game_destroyed);
//   four times a second each report with new damage goes to the alert, a second at least after its
//   last time. Armageddon still has all of this but makes no report for a building whose team is
//   hostile to the player, and does nothing with a report (its alert is gone), so the mod keeps its
//   own, by handle. A building first seen (its zone just loaded) starts from the damage it has.
// What each is worth, and the rest of the rules, are liberation.cpp's (ReportDamage, ReportDeath).
// The EDF's people confronting the player ("the alert in one second") were part of the AI Armageddon
// deleted.
//
// Every address is Armageddon's (the publicbeta build): the world's people and vehicles (0x43A860 and
// 0x43A8B0, 0x477090 and 0x4770E0: how many, and each), a person's team (+0x13B4) and how one team
// takes another (0x8A0460), whether something is dead (the fifth virtual function, as Guerrilla's), a
// person's AI (+0x174C) with its perception 0x14 in, whose beliefs of a kind are a list (0x42DA30 the
// first, 0x476420 the next; a belief's +0 is whom it is about; kind 5 is the first contact, as in
// Guerrilla), a person's target (0x880B70), a vehicle's table entry (+0x3DA8: +0 its name, +0x30 its
// special type, 3 a tank and 4 an artillery tank, +0x4D8 its alert multiplier), its flags (+0x4FB0,
// Guerrilla's: bit 10 a wreck, bit 29 someone in it) and hit points (0x603920, 0x603930), and the
// weapon in a person's hands (+0x1394 → +8 → +0x20, its table entry: +0x58 its alert multiplier).
// A building (rfg_mover; the world's, 0x4776E0 and 0x477730): its team a signed byte at +0x12E, its
// importance from its gameplay properties (object_mover::get_importance_level, 0x8D75E0), its mover
// flags +0xF0 (bit 2: it makes no reports), its damage percentage +0x13C, its flags +0x150 (bit 4:
// game_destroyed).

/// Red Faction: Guerrilla's vehicles made usable in Armageddon, from the player's own copy of Guerrilla
/// (only read): GuerrillaBuilder.exe's vehicles, for the guerrilla_world mod. For each vehicle asked for:
///   - its model converted (<see cref="GuerrillaVehicles"/>) and packed with its textures (each one of
///     Guerrilla's, from the vehicle's own texture file, as a single-texture file under its alias, its
///     compressed mip levels down to 4 × 4) into a container of its own, named as Guerrilla's
///     (&lt;mesh&gt;.ccar_pc.str2_pc) in overrides\build\pc\cache\, where the game finds a new file by name;
///   - an entry for that container added to Armageddon's vehicle asset list (an override of
///     vehicles.vpp_pc\vehicle_containers.asm_pc, the player's own with ours added), as Armageddon lists
///     its own vehicles (type 27, flags 0x80; the model a primitive of type 11, each texture of type 1);
///   - its vehicles.xtbl entry, Guerrilla's own, added to Armageddon's table, which the guerrilla_world
///     mod hands the game while it starts (mods\guerrilla_world\vehicles.xtbl). The two tables describe a
///     vehicle with nearly the same fields; a field Armageddon's table hasn't is left out (Guerrilla's
///     vehicle family, its sounds' wave bank, ...) unless Armageddon's reader still reads it (the
///     handling fields in <see cref="ReadAnyway"/>), and so is a value Armageddon has no choice for; a
///     field Armageddon requires that Guerrilla's hasn't (its electric hit points, memory slot, the
///     cameras' vertical limits, ...) gets the default Armageddon's description gives it. Its effects
///     (engine fire and smoke, the wreck's fire, exhaust, sparks, its explosion) are Guerrilla's own, as
///     the world builder adds them ("rfg_" names: see <see cref="VehicleEffects"/>). For now also left
///     out: the sounds (Guerrilla's are XACT cues, Armageddon plays Wwise events), the lights (Armageddon
///     lights a vehicle through its own Lights map), and the turrets;
///   - its vehicle_interactions.xtbl entry (where the player and passengers get in, sit, move between
///     seats and get out, and how: opening the door, climbing in, quick and diving exits, crawling out of
///     an upturned car), Guerrilla's own, added to Armageddon's table
///     (mods\guerrilla_world\vehicle_interactions.xtbl, handed over the same way). Both games name the
///     same steps, actions and animation states ("vehicle enter primary 1" ends in "driving forward",
///     which is what puts the player behind the wheel); Guerrilla's Door is Armageddon's Door_1. The
///     doors' sound cues are left out until Guerrilla's audio is ported;
///   - the animation set the interaction plays (Vehicle_Taxi, ...), Guerrilla's own, with its
///     animations as Guerrilla has them (re-encoded for Armageddon; Mason is the player in Guerrilla's
///     world, and its people use the same skeletons) and packed in the vehicle's container
///     (<see cref="GuerrillaAnimationSets"/>). Without the animations a transition that names a door
///     stops the player at it ("Vehicle interaction anim missing open 'DOOR_L' anim or trigger"): the
///     door opens on the "door start" and "door end" triggers of the person's animation.

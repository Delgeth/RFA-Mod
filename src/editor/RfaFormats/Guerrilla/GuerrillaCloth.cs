/// <summary>
/// Guerrilla's cloth, for Armageddon: so far Mason's coat, whose tails swing as he moves and blow in the wind.
///
/// Both games move cloth with the same code of Volition's own (not Havok's): a cloth file (.sim_pc) gives a set of
/// nodes, each on a bone of the wearer's skeleton. Some are pinned to the body (anchors), the rest swing on links
/// between them, pulled by gravity and the wind, and kept out of the body by capsules on its bones. Each frame
/// the game moves the swinging nodes and sets their bones from them. The cloth files are in cloth_sim.vpp_pc,
/// each in a container of its own (x.sim_pc.str2_pc), and all of them are listed in its cloth_containers.asm_pc
/// and loaded at start-up. When an item or a person is made, the game looks a cloth up by the name of its mesh
/// (the file's own name, at +4). Guerrilla does that for every item and person. Armageddon does it only for an
/// item with the cloth_sim flag or a character with the "cloth sim" flag. Both read the weather's wind, which
/// the guerrilla_world mod blows as Guerrilla's in our worlds, so a ported cloth takes Guerrilla's wind with no
/// more work.
///
/// The file (version 1 in both games), from Guerrilla's cloth_sim_info:
///
///   +0x00  version (1); +0x04 the name (28 bytes); +0x20 passes; +0x24 air resistance; +0x28 and +0x2C the
///          wind's multiplier and constant; +0x30 gravity's multiplier; +0x34 how much of the wearer's motion
///          it takes; +0x38 and +0x3C two node counts (below); +0x40 links; +0x44 capsules; +0x48, +0x4C and
///          +0x50 where the nodes, links and capsules are (0 in the file: set at load)
///   +0x54  the nodes, 36 bytes each: bone (-1 none), parent node (-1 none), gravity link (the link to its
///          parent, by number; -1 none), a flag (below), which capsules it collides with (u32, a bit each), its
///          wind multiplier, its offset from its bone and its place on the body
///   then   the links, 16 bytes each: the two nodes (below), which capsules it collides with, its length and
///          how far it may stretch (a share of its length, in both games)
///   then   the capsules, 52 bytes each: bone, whether a capsule (else a sphere), radius, height, position,
///          axis, position from its bone
///
/// The two games' files differ in three ways (the rest is the same, record for record):
/// - The node counts. Guerrilla lists the anchors first: +0x38 is how many anchors, +0x3C how many swinging
///   nodes after them, and the node's flag byte is unused (0). Armageddon's files mix the anchors in: +0x38 is
///   all the nodes, +0x3C the anchors among them, and an anchor's flag byte is 1 (its cloth_sim_create,
///   0x96E7A0, sizes the nodes by +0x38 and the anchors' places by +0x3C, and copies the flag into each running
///   node, 0x96EB8D).
/// - A link's two nodes. Guerrilla's are 16 bits each (+0 and +2; its simulate reads them as words, 0x8078FD);
///   Armageddon's are a byte each (+0 and +1, the next two bytes unused; 0x97186B and every other reader). Read
///   Armageddon's way, Guerrilla's links all end at node 0 (the high byte of the first node), and the cloth
///   bunches up round that one anchor.
/// - The gravity link's sign. Guerrilla reads it as a signed byte (0x807B0B), so a link numbered past 127 (the
///   coat's hood, links 145-152) is "none" there; Armageddon reads it unsigned (0x971AD5) and would take it.
///   It's made -1 (none in both), as Guerrilla has it.
/// The capsules sit on the wearer's body (the wearer's bone matrices handed to each step; Guerrilla's
/// collider_rig), the nodes on the item's own skeleton. A cloth here is Guerrilla's file with those three put
/// Armageddon's way.
///
/// Its limits (Armageddon's, the same as Guerrilla's but the first): 64 cloth files loaded (0x96F6C1); 115
/// cloths running at once (0x96EC63); a 64 KB pool for the files (0xA46CC0, "Cloth Sim Mempool"), of which
/// Armageddon's own 25 take 34,788 bytes; a 256 KB pool for the cloths running.
///

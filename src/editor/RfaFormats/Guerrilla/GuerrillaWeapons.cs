/// tables at start-up. For each weapon asked for:
///   - its item (items_3d.xtbl: the model in the hand and on the ground, and its props, such as the
///     assault rifle's magazine), Guerrilla's own entry: its static mesh converted
///     (<see cref="GuerrillaStaticMeshes"/>) and packed with its low-detail textures (from Guerrilla's
///     items_containers.cpeg_pc, each a single-texture file under its alias, as the world's) in a
///     container named as the item (as Armageddon's: the item m16 is m16.str2_pc, type 22); its big
///     textures and high-detail material file (Guerrilla's "&lt;mesh&gt;_high" container) in
///     "&lt;item&gt;_high.str2_pc" (type 25), which Armageddon loads for an item flagged high_res_map
///     (Guerrilla's high_res_map_large), by that name (0x7D99F0). Both containers in an override of
///     items.vpp_pc\items_containers.asm_pc (the player's own list with ours added);
///   - its inventory item (items_inventory.xtbl), Guerrilla's, its name shown as Guerrilla shows it (its
///     strings file's text for the tag);
///   - an ammo type of its own (ammo.xtbl): Guerrilla's ammo is the weapon's, Armageddon's shared by
///     weapons naming the same type. Both count the loaded magazine in: Guerrilla's Max_Rounds (its
///     weapon::add_ammo keeps the reserve at most Max_Rounds − Magazine_Size), Armageddon's Max_Reserve (a
///     type's reserve holds it less the rounds loaded in the guns using it, 0x70EB80), so Max_Reserve is
///     Max_Rounds. Its upgraded number (Max_Rounds_Upgrade, once the weapon's upgrade is bought to its
///     "... AMMO" level) the guerrilla_gear mod sets at run time (<see cref="AmmoCapacityFile"/>);
///   - its weapon entry (weapons.xtbl): Guerrilla's flat entry written as Armageddon's one firing mode
///     (field by field: Armageddon's own m16 is Guerrilla's, so moved, with the same numbers);
///   - what the entry names that both games have under one name but differently (the NPCs' firing
///     pattern, aim drift): Guerrilla's under "rfg_" names; one both have alike is used as it is.
/// Names: Guerrilla's, or with "rfg_" before them where Armageddon has one of that name (m16, enforcer,

/// <summary>
/// Red Faction: Guerrilla's player animations for its guns, played by Armageddon's player while he holds
/// one of Guerrilla's guns (GuerrillaWeapons builds this with the guns). Both games pick an
/// animation the same way: a character has one animation set, and its code asks the set for a state
/// (standing, walking, aiming, ...) or an action (firing, reloading, ...) in the animation group of the
/// gun held (AK for the assault rifle); a set that hasn't it asks the set it builds on
/// (Parent_Skeleton), then the group's parent group. Armageddon's player's set is vs_player, which its
/// people's sets build on too, and Guerrilla's group names are Armageddon's (Enforcer and Railgun hold
/// Armageddon's own guns as well). So Guerrilla's are a set of their own, rfg_player, built on vs_player,
/// and taken up only while one of Guerrilla's guns is held: the guerrilla_gear mod switches the player to
/// it with the game's own animation-set variants (as Armageddon plays a drunk or wounded civilian's
/// set), under the variant "confident", which nothing of Armageddon's uses. What rfg_player hasn't
/// (Armageddon's own moves: dodging, free running, the Nano Forge) stays Darius's.
///
/// For each group the guns use:
///   - Guerrilla's group as Guerrilla's game plays it: its own entries, then those of the groups it
///     builds on in Guerrilla's anim_groups.xtbl (the enforcer's are mostly the assault rifle's);
///   - the names Armageddon's player asks for (its blend tree's and Darius's set's), each from
///     Guerrilla's entry of that name or, where Guerrilla has none, from the one of Guerrilla's that
///     plays the same (<see cref="Aliases"/>: Armageddon's "fire" is Guerrilla's "stand fire", its
///     upgraded reloads are the plain reloads, ...); the cut cover system and the rest Armageddon never
///     asks for are left out;
///   - a blend tree of Guerrilla's (its walking and running blend a few animations by speed, a table
///     Armageddon can't read) is the one of its animations for the speed Armageddon's name is for:
///     Armageddon's player tree blends walking, running and sprinting itself;
///   - each animation moved from Mason's skeleton onto Darius's (<see cref="GuerrillaAnimations"/>),
///     under the name rfgpl_ + Guerrilla's, written into mods\guerrilla_gear\animations\, which the mod
///     loads once and keeps (as Armageddon keeps its player's), with Guerrilla's anim_files.xtbl entry:
///     its triggers (when a reload hands over the ammo), its hand IK and its props (the magazine moved
///     from the gun to the hand and back), what Armageddon's tables have of them; its sounds where the
///     guns' banks have them (a swing's whoosh: the caller's sound maker), the rest waiting for Guerrilla's
///     audio; its moving versions (a variant tagged Forward: the hammer swung on the move, which carries
///     Mason forward), made too though no group names them.
/// The lists the set and its animations go in (anim_set_filenames.xtbl, anim_files.xtbl) are shared with
/// the vehicles' and people's tools: this starts from the ones in mods\guerrilla_world\ and replaces only
/// its own entries, recorded in mods\guerrilla_gear\anim_entries.txt.

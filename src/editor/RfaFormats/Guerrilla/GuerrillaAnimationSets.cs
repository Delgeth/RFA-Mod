/// Red Faction: Guerrilla's animation sets made usable in Armageddon, for GuerrillaArsenal. A set
/// (a Skeleton_Set table, such as Guerrilla's vehicle_taxi.xtbl) names the animation each state and
/// action plays: for a vehicle, getting in, sitting, driving, getting out, diving out. Both games read
/// sets the same way while they start: the list of sets (anim_set_filenames.xtbl), every animation's
/// triggers and flags (anim_files.xtbl), then each listed set's table by its file name. For each set
/// asked for:
///   - its animations, from the vehicle's own container or Guerrilla's anims.vpp_pc, to be packed in the
///     vehicle's container as Armageddon packs its own vehicles' player animations: as Guerrilla has them,
///     in Armageddon's packing, for the people who drive in Guerrilla's world (Mason, Guerrilla's NPCs:
///     their own skeletons; retargetToDarius false), or moved from Mason's skeleton onto Darius's
///     (<see cref="PlayerRetarget"/>, given Armageddon's anims.vpp_pc to learn the two skeletons from; else
///     <see cref="GuerrillaAnimations"/>). Moved onto Darius, one Armageddon has itself on Darius (its
///     developers moved it: the same name and frame count, in its preloaded animations) is played by its
///     own name instead, with Armageddon's own entry;
///   - each animation's anim_files.xtbl entry, Guerrilla's own, added to Armageddon's table: its
///     triggers (when a door opens and is open, when the camera and the person's place hand over, the
///     footsteps) and its flags. Its sounds and voice lines (Guerrilla's are XACT cues) are left out
///     until Guerrilla's audio is ported;
///   - the set's table, Guerrilla's own, as a new file the game finds by name (it isn't in the game's
///     start-up copy of its tables), listed in anim_set_filenames.xtbl;
///   - the state and action names it uses that Armageddon's tables haven't (Guerrilla's code names some
///     itself, as "driver look back", which Armageddon's code doesn't), added to anim_states.xtbl and
///     anim_actions.xtbl, so the set reads whole.
/// The changed lists are handed to the game by the guerrilla_world mod (mods\guerrilla_world\). A name
/// Armageddon already uses (a set, an animation) gets the prefix rfg_; the others keep Guerrilla's.
/// The four lists are shared with the other tools that add sets (GuerrillaPeople's people): given

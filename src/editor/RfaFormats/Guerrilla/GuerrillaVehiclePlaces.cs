/// Red Faction: Guerrilla's roads and parked vehicles, as Armageddon's zone objects, for the world builder.
/// Both games have the classes, written the same way by Volition's tools:
///   - object_path_road: a road (its points, each a position, a curve handle and a width; then its
///     junctions, each another road by handle and the points joined) in path_road_struct and
///     path_road_data, its flags (ambient traffic, one way, special, no reinforcements, GPS only) in
///     path_road_flags, and the tools' own prev/NEXT, op, Outer_Radius and speed_limit. Guerrilla's 261
///     roads are kept as they are with their handles (their junctions name each other by handle, across
///     zones), in the zone and again in its persistent p_ zone as Guerrilla has them (Armageddon's own
///     levels put theirs in the zone alone).
///   - object_vehicle_spawn_node: a parked vehicle's spot: the vehicle spawn group it picks from
///     (spawn_set), its chance, and whether the player's chosen vehicle may come back there. The group is
///     Guerrilla's of that name, which the vehicles part writes into spawn_group_vehicle.xtbl as
///     <see cref="GroupPrefix"/> + its name (three of Guerrilla's names are Armageddon's too). Guerrilla's
///     night chance, special vehicle and no-parking flags aren't read by Armageddon's.

/// <summary>
/// Red Faction: Guerrilla's people made usable in Armageddon, from the player's own copy of Guerrilla
/// (only read): GuerrillaBuilder.exe's people, for the guerrilla_people and guerrilla_world mods. Armageddon's
/// character code is Guerrilla's with fields added: its character reader still reads Guerrilla's
/// fields, and it takes each character's bones from that character's own skeleton. So Guerrilla's
/// people keep their own meshes, skeletons and animations (nothing is moved onto another skeleton).
/// For each character asked for (Guerrilla's character.xtbl entry name):
///   - its body mesh converted (<see cref="GuerrillaCharacterMeshes"/>), its materials on Guerrilla's
///     own shaders' skinned rewrites (<see cref="GuerrillaShaders"/>), packed with its textures (each
///     one of Guerrilla's as a single-texture file under its alias, as the world's and the vehicles')
///     into a container of its own named as the character (&lt;Name&gt;.str2_pc in
///     overrides\build\pc\cache\), listed in an override of humans.vpp_pc\character_containers.asm_pc
///     (Armageddon's own list with ours added) as Armageddon lists its people (type 19). Characters
///     whose containers are the same in Guerrilla (its troopers, mercenaries and lieutenants are all
///     greene, file for file) share the first one's, as Armageddon's Shared_Container does (and
///     Guerrilla's own shared_container, its riot-shield elite's);
///   - its skeleton, Guerrilla's file as it is (the same format), a new file the guerrilla_people mod
///     has the game load by name (mods\guerrilla_people\rigs.txt);
///   - its animation set (Male, ...; with the sets it builds on), Guerrilla's own as rfg_&lt;set&gt;,
///     every animation it names as rfgp_&lt;animation&gt; (Armageddon has its own of the same names, for its
///     own skeletons: 137 bones, Guerrilla's 52 to 64; and the vehicles' rfg_ ones are moved onto
///     Armageddon's player), re-packed in Armageddon's key packing with the
///     tracks of the 52 bones every Guerrilla person's skeleton shares in the same order (the bones
///     after them are each skeleton's own: Mason's camera, the EDF's shoulder pads, coats). Guerrilla
///     kept them in its animations archive, loaded once and kept; so are they here, each a file in
///     mods\guerrilla_people\animations\ that the guerrilla_people mod loads and keeps when the game
///     loads its own archive (not in the characters' containers: every set builds on Male, and an
///     animation in two containers belongs to whichever loaded first and goes when it goes).
///     Guerrilla's blend trees (a walk blended between its uphill, level and downhill versions by the
///     ground's slope) have no reader in Armageddon: a state naming one plays its level animation for
///     now. The set lists (anim_set_filenames.xtbl, anim_files.xtbl, anim_states.xtbl, anim_actions.xtbl)
///     are shared with GuerrillaArsenal's vehicles: this starts from the ones already in
///     mods\guerrilla_world\ and replaces only its own entries;
///   - its character.xtbl entry, Guerrilla's own fields, added to Armageddon's table
///     (mods\guerrilla_world\character.xtbl, which guerrilla_world hands the game at start-up). A field
///     Armageddon's description hasn't is left out (Guerrilla's height and its variation: Armageddon's
///     reader no longer reads them); Guerrilla's Anim_Set is Armageddon's Animation_Sets list; a field
///     Armageddon requires that Guerrilla has no counterpart for gets its description's default, or,
///     where it has none, a value named here (<see cref="ArmageddonOnly"/>). Left out for now: the
///     weapons (they come with Guerrilla's guns, GuerrillaArsenal --weapons; never Armageddon's), the
///     voices (Guerrilla's are XACT personas), the props and heads not made yet (the character-mesh
///     props in its container, <see cref="PortProps"/>, and the heads with no morph, <see cref="PortHeads"/>,
///     are made: Mason's coat and face). Its ragdoll is Guerrilla's
///     (<see cref="GuerrillaRagdoll"/>: ragdoll_type, written with the table).
/// The names of the characters made are listed in mods\guerrilla_people\people.txt: in the worlds the
/// guerrilla_people mod plays, it reserves them in the level's spawn resource (where one is in force,
/// as in our worlds, the game makes only the people the resource holds).

/// Blinn and self-illumination), gw_metal0/1/2 (its metal: the metal lobe), gw_brdf0/1/2 (its BRDF
/// shaders: their fitted curves or look-up maps), gw_blendmetal0/1/2 (metal and standard mixed by
/// the specular map's alpha), gw_glass0 (its blended glass), gw_eosglass1 (its mirror glass) and
/// gw_composite1c (its composite panels), gw_vehiclepaint0/1 (its vehicles' paint) and gw_clearcoat1
/// (its Oasis roofs), the number the UV sets past the first their meshes have, then
/// "c" for alpha-tested materials (cut-outs) and "b" for blended ones; each as _s (still meshes) and
/// _bs (instanced ones), and the glass also as _c (skinned: the game draws a pane's flying shards with
/// its material's _c effect, and won't shatter glass whose shader has none), and gw_brdf0,
/// gw_standard0 and gw_standard0c as _c for the people and the character-mesh items (see <see cref="WriteSkinned"/>). They go with
/// the world's other new files (overrides\build\pc\cache\), and the guerrilla_world mod has the game
/// load them after its own (the game only loads the effect files inside its archives).
///
/// Each takes its G-buffer passes (the normals, plain and stippled) and the engine's texture slots
/// from Armageddon's ir_default as they are (but gw_glass, which has no G-buffer pass: Guerrilla's
/// glass casts no shadow and Armageddon then skips a blended material's G-buffer and shadow passes,
/// nor the blended "b" ones; and the cut-outs, whose depth (shadow) and G-buffer passes are ours too,
/// so their holes are cut by Guerrilla's own alpha in every pass, as ir_at_default lays them out),
/// and adds its own material pass, compiled from
/// Guerrilla\Shaders\GuerrillaSurfaces.hlsl, which lights the surface with Guerrilla's maths from
/// what the mod gives it. The material pass of objects fading in or out (stippled) is the plain one.
/// The materials name Guerrilla's own texture slots and these constants, register by register (the
/// first five where ir_default's G-buffer shaders read theirs):
/// IR_Object_ID (the engine's), Normal_Map_Height, Specular_Power, the normal map's tiling U and V,
/// Diffuse_Color, Specular_Color, then four values each: gw_Tiling, gw_Decals, gw_Shine, gw_Glow,
/// gw_Scroll, gw_Extra, then BRDF_Diff_1-3, BRDF_Spec_1-3, gw_Brdf, gw_MetalSpecular,
